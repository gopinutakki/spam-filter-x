By tradition, all that my late husband\r\nhad, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And\r\nmyself is to be remarried by his immediate younger\r\nbrother which I vehemently refused. They have taken\r\nall that I suffered with my husband to acquire\r\nincluding treasures, houses and his bank particular\r\nseized by them. I wanted to escape to the United State\r\nof America [USA} with my children on exile, but again\r\nthey conspired and stole my international passport and\r\nother traveling document to further frustrate me.\r\n\r\nThank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code\r\nfrom a Security Company abroad, that my late husband deposited U.S\r\n$45.5 Million cash with this company. It has therefore, become very\r\nnecessary and urgent to contact someone, a foreigner like you to\r\nhelp me receive/secure these funds overseas in a reliable bank Account\r\n(presumably an empty Bank Account, if available) and to help invest\r\nit on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet\r\nwith you in your country.\r\n\r\nThese funds are kept on an \"OPEN BENEFICIARY MANDATE\"\r\nwith the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure\r\nor diversion. I have had several telephone discussions\r\nwith the Assistant Director of the security company,\r\nwho has express willingness to help me on meeting the\r\ncompany\'s demands. This is why I have\r\ncontacted you to help save my children and I, receive\r\nthese funds on our behalf. But, you would need to give\r\nme sufficient assurance that if you help me, you would\r\nnot divert the funds. My children and I have resolved\r\nto give you 30\% of the total sum. This is all my\r\nchildren and I have got to live on.\r\n\r\nPlease, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope\r\nyou will not disappoint me.

My operational base was in Freetown the capital\r\ncity. In January 1999, when the second civil war broke out in my country,\r\nthe Revolutionary United Front Rebels, who invaded Freetown, burned my\r\noffice and warehouse. In that attack, I lost all my properties and assets.\r\nI was left with virtually nothing, except some money I had in the Bank.\r\n\r\nWhen the United Nations sent in\r\ntroops to quell the rebel\'s onslaught and there was a\r\nrelative peace in Freetown, I returned to business,\r\nbut this time, I invested my resources in the Mining\r\nof Diamond through the help of a third party,\r\nsome Lebanese who were very much versed in the\r\nindustry to Antwerp in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe returns I got from this business were quite good and my life was\r\ngradually picking up again until early this year when the Sierra-Leonean\r\ngovernment banned private exportation of the Diamond at the international\r\nmarket. The U.N. obliged the government and it is now illegal to sell/buy\r\nDiamond emanating from Sierra-Leone. Following this action, the government\r\nof my country clamped down on all businessmen who had made fortunes\r\nselling Diamond.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my newly acquired properties were seized again and I had no\r\noption than to leave the country immediately to a neighboring west African\r\ncountry, where I met our Lord Jesus Christ and my life was totally\r\ntransformed. But before I left I was able to first move my money out of\r\nthe country. I had $10,500,000 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United\r\nStates Dollars) in my domiciliary account in Freetown. I had to move the\r\nmoney out of the Country through a very secret arranged channel, in a very\r\nunconventional method this was done by my friend an official at the\r\nSecurity Minting & Printing Company of my country. Presently, this money\r\nis in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm.\r\n\r\nMy ministry is basically a prayer and deliverance ministry. Since I\r\nreceived my calling and joined my ministry, I have been asking God to\r\npurify what remains of my wealth for evangelical works and for orphanage.\r\nOn the last day of a special fasting and praying session in my ministry,\r\nthere was a divine revelation from God that I should invest in your\r\nministry.

Let\'s take your phone and all of the media you have on it to the next level. Let\'s turn that phone into a jukebox full of music, movies, and photos that you can play on almost any TV, stereo system, computer, or other device you may come across, whether you\'re moving from the living room to your bedroom or your house to a friend\'s place. The technology is already built into your phone and the gear you have at home; all you need to do is unlock it. Here\'s how.\r\n\r\nNearly every television, router, smartphone, AV receiver, Blu-ray player, and any other electronic appliance in your home with network capability sold in the past few years supports DLNA or UPnP. We\'ll explain those in more detail later, but the important thing is that this technology, which is probably already available on some of your devices, gives you the ability to connect anything on a network with media to anything else on the same network that can play it.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll walk you through how you can use your iOS or Android device as the media source that you always have in your pocket—full of music, movies, web video, photos, and more—and play that media on any device in any room, without cables, syncing, or a computer in the middle. All you need is an app or two and the right gear. Let\'s get started.\r\n\r\nWhat You\'ll Need\r\n\r\nThere are a few prerequisites to make this work.\r\n\r\n An iOS or Android smartphone, full of music, movies, or photos (or even web video and streamimg music)\r\nA home network that your smartphone can connect to via Wi-Fi\r\nA DLNA or UPnP-compatible television, home stereo, Blu-ray player, computer or media center app, Apple TV or set-top box, or any other home electronics appliance that connect to your home network, either wired or via Wi-Fi. Click here to see if your electronics are DLNA compliant, and click here to see if they\'re UPnP compliant.\r\nA DLNA/UPnP-compliant player for your smartphone that can stream your media to your electronics. We chose Twonky for iOS and Android.\r\nBefore you get started, keep in mind that this will only work with devices that are connected to your home network. If your TV isn\'t connected, you\'ll need something connected to your TV that is—for example, a set-top box, HTPC, or even a DLNA-compliant Blu-ray player. Odds are you have at least one appliance connected to your home theater setup or living room TV that\'s compatible.\r\n\r\nWhen I set this up myself, I was dismayed to learn that many of my electronics weren\'t supported. My reciever was too old, my TV wasn\'t connected to my home network, and the Xbox 360 uses a Microsoft-proprietary version of DLNA that doesn\'t play well with others. However, if you have an Apple TV, PlayStation 3, anything running XBMC, a relatively new Blu-Ray player or receiver, or almost any other set-top box or network-connected stereo, you\'re probably already set. Take a look again at the DLNA product search and UPnP product search to see if any of your gear is compatible.\r\n\r\nStep One: Install and Set up Twonky Mobile\r\n\r\nWe chose Twonky Mobile for a couple of reasons. First, it\'s available to iOS and Android users, uses the same interface, and offers the same features to both types of devices. Apple users have the benefit of AirPlay (which we\'ll get to a little later) but using Twonky allows you to leverage apps that aren\'t AirPlay compatible and push to devices that don\'t support AirPlay. Oh, and did we mention Twonky is completely free?\r\n\r\nTo get started, grab Twonky Mobile from the iTunes App Store or the Android App Market. Once installed, fire up the app and let it scan your home network. It\'ll display the name of the network it\'s connected to, and then ask you to select a server. Any open media library will be shown here, including any computers on your network with Windows Media Center running, but go ahead and select your phone (listed as \"TwonkyServer Mobile\") from the list of available media libraries.\r\n\r\nThe app will then ask you to select a \"player,\" or a compatible device it should use to show your photos and videos or play your music. If you don\'t see anything in the list yet, that\'s okay, but if your set-top box, XBMC system, internet-connected TV, or other compatible gear is powered on and connected to your home network, you may already see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep Two: Choose Your Player\r\n\r\nIf the player you want to use isn\'t in the list, it\'s either not powered on, not currently connected, or it\'s not DLNA or UPnP compliant. If you don\'t see your TV in the list, for example, power on your Blu-ray player, receiver, or set-top box and re-scan to see if it shows up and use that instead. When you move to another room, make sure your stereo is connected to your home network and turn it on—if it\'s DLNA compliant, it\'ll show up in the list as well. Go ahead and choose the player you want to use.\r\n\r\nAs you move from room to room, or even go over to a friend\'s house, you\'ll need to re-scan for available devices. It\'s a little annoying, but the only way to make sure they\'re always in the list is to either keep them on all the time, or power them on before you start up Twonky. Once they\'re available to select, playing your media is just a tap away.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, Twonky does a great job of scouring your home network for available players—a job that other tools I tried didn\'t do quite so well at. I was surprised to see my Apple TV in the list on my Android phone, and my XBMC-enabled HTPC in the list just because the system was on and XBMC was currently running.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep Three: Press Play\r\n\r\nOne of the other reasons we chose Twonky for this is because once you\'ve selected your library and your player, the app then allows you to immediately select what you want to stream from your phone to your player. I sat on the couch in front of my TV and started playing music from my phone on my HTPC without so much as lifting a finger to configure XBMC to allow that to happen. The same was true when I went into the bedroom and turned on my Apple TV—I just told Twonky to select the Apple TV as a player, queued up a couple of songs, and pressed play.\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t want to be confined to the media on your phone, Twonky inserts itself into the iOS and Android \"share\" menus, so if you\'re viewing a photo in your gallery or camera roll, you can \"share\" it with Twonky to display it on the big screen, or if you\'re listening to a podcast you can share it with Twonky to play it on your stereo or through your Blu-ray player to your television.\r\n\r\nI had a good experience with Twonky here, but it\'s definitely not perfect. There were some instances where a video I wanted to play just wouldn\'t work—specifically streaming from my Android phone to my Apple TV,, and there were time when we wanted to play a single video or view a single photo and Twonky started queuing our entire photo or video library. Even so, most of the issues were fixed by choosing media types that would actually play, and by restarting the Twonky app so we could get a fresh start. Since there\'s nothing you can do to troubleshoot the player and you\'re limited to the controls in the Twonky Mobile app on your Android or iOS device, you may feel like you don\'t have enough control over what the app does. Be patient, and don\'t be afraid to just turn it off, turn it back on, and try again.\r\n\r\nAirPlay and Other Options\r\n\r\nIf all of your gadget are somehow connected to Apple devices, you may not even need Twonky. AirPlay offers a seamless, integrated method to stream music, video, and just about anything else from your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad to any other iOS device, like an Apple TV or an Apple computer. Going the DLNA route however allows you to stream media from apps that don\'t have AirPlay support to devices that may not be AirPlay compatible. However, if all of your TVs are connected to Apple TVs, and your handhelds are iOS devices, you can accomplish most of this without an additional app. Still, if you\'re stuck with an app that doesn\'t support AirPlay and want to share it, you can try this hack we shared a while ago to at least get the audio going.\r\n\r\nAndroid users on the other hand have a wealth of alternatives, but not all of them are polished. I tried the previously mentioned Skifta, which has a lot more polish (and handled play/pause/queuing songs much more smoothly) and offers some cloud-streaming features that Twonky doesn\'t, but found that Skifta had more difficulty finding compatible devices on my network than Twonky did, and even though Skifta claims some XBox 360 support (and indeed, shows it as a player in the app,) it doesn\'t work at all. Skifta also won\'t support the Apple TV. Still, Skifta worked seamlessly with my Blu-ray player and XBMC devices, and supported more file types than Twonky did, so it\'s a great alternative if Twonky doesn\'t work for you, or you\'re looking for another tool.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of apps in the Android market that allow you to pull media from other sources on your home network to your Android phone instead of push media from your Android phone to another player, but Twonky and Skifta are some of the few that allow you to do both whenever you choose.\r\n\r\nGo Forth and Stream\r\n\r\nThere are dozens of ways to pull media from your media library on your laptop, or your movie collection on your home computer to your Android or iOS device and enjoy it on the go. We\'ve discussed several methods for this in the past. Even so, there\'s something great about being able to go to a friend\'s house, talk about a video you saw or a song you heard, and instead of have everyone crowd around your tiny phone screen, just push the video to their TV, or play the song on their stereo for everyone to hear. There\'s also nothing like being able to walk into my bedroom, turn on my phone, and continue the music I was just listening to in the living room with a couple of taps. The best part of all of this is that the technology is already in your pocket, and probably already in your house—you just have to take advantage of it.'

The South African government seems to be\r\nplaying along with them.I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount\r\nof money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience\r\nin future,both countries have similar political history.As a businessman,I\r\nam seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my\r\nfamily in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is risk\r\nfree.If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for\r\nme,is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the\r\nconsignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i\r\nhave already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the\r\nNetherlands from South Africa.But bef ore then all modalities will have to\r\nbe put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more\r\nimportantly this money I intend to use for investment.\r\n\r\nI have two options for you.Firstly you can choose to have certain\r\npercentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.\r\nOr you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable\r\ninvestment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want,feel\r\nfree to notify me.I have also mapped out 5\% of this money for all kinds of\r\nexpenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer\r\na partnership I am willing to give you 10\% of the money while the\r\nremaining 85\% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with\r\nthis E-mail address (maimo2@lycos.com)while I implore you to maintain the\r\nabsolute secrecy required in this transaction.'

In bringing this message of \r\ngoodwill to you,\r\nI have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains. \r\n \r\nI am Mr. Kola Olawuyi, Branch Manager, Diamond  Bank of Nigeria. \r\nI managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself. \r\nTime is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to \r\nassist me in this\r\nconfidential business.\r\n\r\nA British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum \r\nCorporation, \r\nMr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on \r\nJanuary 6, 1999, \r\nvalued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars), for twelve \r\n(12) calendar months in my branch.\r\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \r\nbut got no reply. \r\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his \r\ncontract employers, \r\nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian \r\nBest died from an automobile accident. \r\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a \r\nWILL, \r\nand all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made \r\nfurther investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not \r\ndeclare any kin\r\nor relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit \r\npaperwork in my Bank.\r\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the \r\ninterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each \r\nyear.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.\r\nAccording to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the \r\nmoney will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if \r\nnobody applies to claim the fund.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand \r\nin as the next of \r\nkin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man\'s labor \r\nwill not get into \r\nthe hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will \r\nlike you to provide \r\nimmediately your full names and address so that the attorney will \r\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in \r\nplace as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers \r\nfor drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary \r\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the \r\ntransfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide \r\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the \r\nbeneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us \r\nto share in the ratio of 60\% for me and 40\% for you.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction would be \r\ndone by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager \r\nguarantees the successful execution of this transaction.\r\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via the private Fax or \r\nemail address below;\r\n\r\nolakola01@excite.com  .

spam,'I am Bada Musa, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF\r\nNIGERIA, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very\r\nconfidential business proposition for you.\r\nOn June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor\r\nwith the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.\r\nBarry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for\r\ntwelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00\r\n(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon\r\nmaturity, I sent a routine notification to his\r\nforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we\r\nsent a reminder and finally we discovered from his\r\ncontract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum\r\nCorporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an\r\nautomobile accident. On further investigation, I found\r\nout that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to\r\ntrace his next of kin were fruitless.\r\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered\r\nthat Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin\r\nin all his official documents, including his Bank\r\nDeposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is\r\nstill sitting in the Bank and the interest is being\r\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each\r\nyear. No one will come forward to claim it. According\r\nto the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five)\r\nyears, the money will revert to the ownership of the\r\nNigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the\r\nfunds.\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\r\nforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry\r\nKelly so that the fruits of this old man\'s labor will\r\nnot get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This\r\nis simple, I will like you to provide me immediately\r\nwith your full names and address so that the attorney\r\nwill prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,\r\nwhich will put you in place as the next of kin. We\r\nshall employ the services of two attorneys for\r\ndrafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the\r\nnecessary documents and letter of\r\nprobate/administration in your favor the transfer. A\r\nbank account in any part of the world, which you\r\nprovide, will then facilitate the transfer of this\r\nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money\r\nwill be paid into your account for us to share in the\r\nratio of 60\% for me and 40\% for you.\r\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this\r\ntransaction will be done by the attorney and my\r\nposition as the Branch Manager guarantees the\r\nsuccessful execution of this transaction. If you are\r\ninterested, please reply immediately via the private\r\nemail address below. Upon your response, I shall then\r\nprovide you with more details and relevant documents\r\nthat will help you understand. Please observe utmost\r\nconfidentiality, and rest assured that this\r\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us\r\nbecause I shall require your assistance to invest my\r\nshare in your country.\r\nAwaiting your urgent reply via email. \r\n'

Sure, hard work helps, but the truth is, your self perception may be getting in the way. We all form our own realities, and those realities aren\'t perfect. Your self perception can be very limiting, and shaking up your notion of the world can do wonders for your productivity, creativity, and happiness. Here\'s how to recalibrate your reality.\r\n\r\nRemember the last time you lost confidence after your boss was disappointed in your work—or maybe you were stood up by a friend? You second-guessed yourself after that, and ultimately your work or personal life suffered. The idea behind recalibrating your reality is pretty simple. When you get locked into a view of the world you get stuck in routines and you lose sight of different viewpoints. Recalibrating that view can help you solve problems, win arguments, and even be happier. But how do we actually do it? We\'ll take a look at a few of the different methods you can use to recalibrate your perception of the world and yourself, but first, we have to understand how we perceive the world to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe Basics of How We Perceive the World\r\n\r\nTo get a grasp on how we perceive the world, I talked with David Eagleman, neuroscientist at the Baylor College of Medicine and author of Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain and Timothy Wilson, psychologist at the University of Virginia and author of Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Chance.\r\n\r\nIn a literal sense, you can\'t perceive much more of the world than you already do. You only perceive what you really need in order to survive. David Eagleman explains:\r\n\r\nWe open our eyes and we think we\'re seeing the whole world out there. But what has become clear—and really just in the last few centuries—is that when you look at the electro-magnetic spectrum we are seeing less than 1/10 Billionth of the information that\'s riding on there. So we call that visible light. But everything else passing through our bodies is completely invisible to us.\r\n\r\nEven though we accept the reality that\'s presented to us, we\'re really only seeing a little window of what\'s happening. There\'s so many examples of this, but one that\'s interesting to third-graders, but also neuroscience is optical illusions. [Illusions demonstrate] that these really simple things that you think are going on in front of you are not actually representing physical reality but instead your brain is constructing something.\r\n\r\nOur construction of reality shapes and alters our view of the physical world. It also limits our cognitive ability because we weigh our views more importantly than others. Mr. Wilson explains:\r\n\r\nA lot of this happens unconsciously. We don\'t know how much we\'re interpreting. The world presents itself like it\'s reality and we don\'t know how much we\'ve already filtered that. There\'s a psychologist name Lee Brosan who calls this naive realism. We perceive the world as real, but we\'re doing a lot of spinning as the information comes in. He talks about it as a real impediment when we\'re in an argument because each person sees the world as real and thinks the other must be crazy or deliberately trying to destroy things when in fact they\'re just trying to bring their own expectations and facts to the table.\r\n\r\nRecognizing this limited view is the first step. David Eagleman describes this as the umwelt: the assumption that our reality is the only reality out there. He suggests the first thing we have to do is recognize our umwelt.\r\n\r\nThe key is when you appreciate the umwelt it gives you intellectual humility. You realize that even though you assume this is reality, there is so much you\'re not seeing and so much that\'s a part of other people\'s reality. The usefulness is recognizing this humility when making a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nRecognizing our own umwelt can help us recalibrate our version of reality and start looking at the world in a new and different way. Most of us can\'t do this by flipping a switch and require some exercises to get our brains into the habit of looking through other perspectives before making choices. Let\'s look at some of the ways you can utilize and act on this idea. Photo by neuroticcamel.\r\n\r\nHow to Alter Your Larger Outlook\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest reasons to recalibrate your reality is to attempt to expand your world outlook outside of yourself to help you become a better communicator and expand your problem solving ability. This is easier said than done. Let\'s look at ways you can actually implement it in your day.\r\n\r\nWait Five Minutes Before Your Respond\r\n\r\n\r\nOne regret most of us have is our stupid responses during debates or heated arguments. To help cure that and give yourself time to think, 37signals author Jason Fried suggests a simple approach: give it five minutes. He describes a situation where he was arguing with a speaker at a conference who eventually offered him this advice:\r\n\r\nHe said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it\'s fine to disagree, it\'s fine to push back, it\'s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you\'re sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\r\n\r\nMany arguments don\'t offer the luxury of a five minute response, but others, like email, social networks, or even conferences, give you plenty of time to formulate your response and recalibrate your reality before you say something stupid. Simply letting ideas settle in will inevitably force you to reconsider your own viewpoints, weigh them against your own, and give you an opportunity to come up with a better response. Photo by Valentina Powers.\r\n\r\nForce Yourself to Think from Alternate Points of View in Monotonous Situations\r\n\r\nIt\'s not all about making yourself better at arguing a point. It can also be used as a form of stress relief for daily annoyances. In his commencement speech given to the graduating class at Kenyon University in 2005, author David Foster Wallace talked about the dangers of self-centered worldview and the importance of disrupting our \"default setting\" and views of the world by considering other options.\r\n\r\nHis suggestion is pretty simple. When you get annoyed at a situation or another person, think about why you would do what they\'re doing. For example, if you\'re in the checkout line and a woman smacks her kid, consider how you would end up in that situation. Alternately, if someone cuts you off in traffic, imagine why (or even when) you\'ve done the same thing. Putting yourself in that mindset can change your view of a situation. As Wallace points out, doing this on a regular basis disrupts your default-setting and makes you more conscious of the world around you.\r\n\r\nWrite Out Your Day From Another Point of View\r\n\r\nIn his book, Mr. Wilson talks about the importance of writing things down as a means to understand different perspectives and one way to do that is to take a look at your day—whether that\'s work, your creative life, or happiness—from the third person. He explains:\r\n\r\nSome researchers have developed a method where they say, if something is nagging at us, write about it in the third person so we can look at it as objectively as we can as opposed to immersing ourselves in a negative experience. That kind of distance can be really helpful to change our story and to look at it in a new way and give new meaning to it.\r\n\r\nI think I try to do this sometimes. I remind myself that my interpretation of something is just that—an interpretation. It\'s not the only way. Sometimes it\'s good to to look at a situation the opposite way as an exercise.\r\n\r\nIt might make you feel a little like Bob Dole for a minute, but writing out your day from a different point of view will give you a unique perspective of your situation and can help you pinpoint where a problem is.\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t just about altering your view of the rest of the world though, it\'s also useful to recalibrate your perception of yourself. Let\'s see how you can do it. Photo by vtsr.\r\n\r\nAlter Your Perception of Self to Expand Your Notions of the World\r\n\r\nAs we\'ve seen above, we see the world through our own set of filters, but changing and recognizing those filters isn\'t too difficult. More difficult is editing your self-perception in order to change how you view the world. It\'s a bit difficult to imagine changing your own view, but here\'s a few ways you can do it.\r\n\r\nEdit Your Own Story\r\n\r\nOne of the central themes in Mr. Wilson\'s book is the idea that you unconsciously form your own narratives that frame the world and shape your sense of reality. Like any story, these narratives can be edited with a technique he calls story-editing.\r\n\r\nThe goal of story-editing is to change your personal interpretations of yourself and the social world to make yourself happier. One way Mr. Wilson suggests doing this is using the Pennebaker Writing Exercise. The process is pretty simple.\r\n\r\nFind a quiet, private place to write.\r\nCommit to writing about a problem for fifteen minutes a day for three consecutive days.\r\nEach time your write about a stress or problem, you reveal more and can subsequently edit your version of the story and understand it more. It\'s the same premise as five minute idea mentioned above. The writing exercise creates a self-assessment of your view and helps you consider other sides of a problem. This helps you interpret yourself differently in the social world and can provide insight into how you umwelt affects your decisions, creativity, and productivity.\r\n\r\nChange How You Present Yourself\r\n\r\nNew research from Northwestern University suggests that you may be influenced by how you present yourself. The researchers call this \"enclothed cognition\" and theorizes that clothes have an effect not just on how you\'re seen by the world, but also how you see yourself. Basically, you can alter your self-perception and subsequently your reality by wearing different clothes.\r\n\r\nThe research doesn\'t prove anything yet. Instead, it suggests that our clothes have an impact on how we view ourselves. As an experiment on yourself, outfit yourself differently for a day and take note of how people perceive you how you perceive yourself. Does wearing a tie make you feel like more of an adult? Does a uniform change the way you view work? When your self-perception is changed, so is your view of reality.\r\n\r\nTry on a Different Personality for an Hour\r\n\r\nThe idea of trying on a new personality might seem a little strange if you do it around friends and family, but doing so on a short flight or even in with a random conversation on the bus is an experience that completely alters your reality. It\'s also surprisingly easy to do. Mr. Wilson offers his experience:\r\n\r\nThe idea of trying on a new self can be a fun exercise. So, you\'re on a train or a plane and you\'re chatting with the person next to you and you just try on a new personality. For example, I tend to be a bit more on the introverted side and I often wish I was a little more talkative and socially skilled at parties and things. And that\'s something you can change if you practice it. So sometimes I\'ll just say, I\'m going to be an extrovert. And you know, I\'ll never be Mr. Extrovert, but it\'s amazing how easy it can be if you just try to adopt a different trait.\r\n\r\nI tried this idea myself. As a bit of an introvert, I tried on an extrovert hat while doing some work in a coffee shop one night. To my surprise, simply telling myself, \"I\'m an extrovert for the next two hours,\" actually made me more forthcoming to the person who was clearly trying to ignore me at the next table. It also gave me an idea of the difference in perception between an extrovert and an introvert. Where I typically would go to a coffee shop to work quietly in the corner, I took a seat closer to someone and actually engaged with them. I did this all automatically after I decided I was an extrovert and it wasn\'t until I looked back on it that I realized my seating choice and disposition was influenced by the conscious choice I made earlier.

In a lot of ways it\'s a good thing, because it\'s a great boon to productivity to not have to give cognitive thought to a lot of our daily actions, but it\'s still good to change your world slightly now and again. It\'s easy to do and can have a surprising effect.\r\n\r\nRearrange Your Home Environment to See New Things\r\n\r\nRearranging your home is an oddly relaxing way to explore your own dwelling and take a good look at the reality you form. Over years of living in an apartment or house, objects get hidden away, pictures you meant to hang get stuffed in storage, and you get so relaxed in the world you create that you don\'t spend any time paying attention to it.\r\n\r\nYou don\'t have to completely redo your living room or go out and buy anything. It is as simple as taking down the art on your walls and rearranging them in new places. You could even consider flipping a room to offer a different perspective. The goal is to provide that cognitive bump in the road so that when you walk into your house you\'re forced to reassess the situation slightly and take the time to actually think about what you\'re seeing.\r\n\r\nTake Different Routes and Find New Areas to Explore\r\n\r\nLike the rearranging of your furniture, taking alternate routes is about expanding your reality into something larger and breaking your routine enough to cause you to pause. This doesn\'t mean you have to take a new way to work every day, but it might mean taking a different street to the grocery store or jogging along a different path. When you break your routine, you move away from your reality and take in another section of the world. Photo by Frank Tobia.\r\n\r\nThe end goal of recalibrating your reality is to expand your perception so you can make your life better and more interesting. The above methods can be used to work through creative blocks, problem solve issues at work, and even to deal with minor traumatic events. Once you recognize the umwelt and the embrace the idea that your perception is limited, it opens up all types of new ideas. Do you do things to recalibrate your notion of reality?

'no spam','Hello Gopi, this is Charles and my partner is Kevin. We are really\r\nbehind in our robot project and we could really use your help. We are\r\nbasically trying to have one of our robots communicate with the other by\r\ndistance. We want robot1 to move forward if and only if robot2 is close\r\nto it. I believe this needs wifi am I correct? Is this possible?\r\nNext if we can get that to work, we then want use Strabo so that the two\r\nrobots will know the dimensions of the room and where all of the objects\r\nare. With this knowledge, robot1 will then \"run away\" from robot2 until\r\nit is caught while robot2 will \"chase\" robot1 until it catches it. Think\r\nof two children running after each other in a room until one catches the\r\nother.\r\nSo again:\r\n1.)Make robot1 move when robot2 is close to it\r\n2.)Make robot1 change direction in the room that will keep it from being\r\ncaught\r\n3.)Make robot2 chase after robot1\r\n4.)Make both robots stop when robot2 touches robot1\r\nIs this possible and can you help us please.\r\nPlease feel free to call me at any time on my cell 615 491 8053\r\nAnd can you give me your cell number as well?

'no spam','LinuxBasics Course\r\n\r\nAn Introduction to Linux Basics\r\n\r\nLinuxBasic.org offers our second free Linux class, An Introduction to\r\nLinux Basics.\r\n\r\nLinux can certainly be used as a Desktop without much understanding of\r\nhow it works. This course is designed to give a foundation of\r\nunderstanding of Linux to a beginner who wants to know a little more\r\nabout the system. More advanced Linux users will find an opportunity\r\nto dig deeper into some areas they always wanted to know more about or\r\ndiscover gaps in their knowledge that they didn\'t know existed.\r\n\r\nWe will use LBook, our own edited version of \"Introduction to Linux: A\r\nHands on Guide\" by Machtelt Garrels, as a study guide. We are excited\r\nabout using this guide which is under the GNU Free Documentation\r\nLicense–meaning we can revise it. As we study this guide, we will\r\nupdate it together. We also intend to make an Answer Key for the\r\nexercises in the guide.\r\n\r\nOur heartfelt thanks go to Machtelt Garrels for creating the original\r\nguide and also to you who will join us in studying and revising it for\r\nthe LinuxBasics.org community.\r\n\r\nWhen, Where, How, and How Long\r\n\r\nThe class is set to begin on October 19, 2006. There 11 chapters and\r\nan Intro in the guide. We will spend more than a week on most chapters\r\nand anticipate the class running for about 6 months. A Schedule will\r\nbe posted.\r\n\r\nClass members will read the section for the week and do the exercises\r\nat the end of the chapters. Relevant questions and comments may then\r\nbe discussed on the mailing list; so you will need to join that in\r\norder to participate. See Mailing List page for information.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to introduce yourself on the list at the beginning of\r\nthe class. If you don\'t begin until after October 19, join the list,\r\nintroduce yourself and start with the first week\'s section. There is\r\nno rush to catch up to where others may be. You are free to discuss\r\nwherever you are in the guide or other Linux-related matters on the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nHow much does it cost? Basic requirements\r\n\r\nThis course is free (as in free beer). However, a goodwill\r\ncontribution in the form of active participation, revisions,\r\nsuggestions or ideas would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBasic requirements are a desire to learn, to do reasonable footwork\r\n(reading the material, googling the topics at times, gathering\r\ninformation on your own system), to respect fellow learners, and to\r\nfollow netetiquette. This course being more specifically targeted to\r\nbeginners, there aren\'t really that many requirements. However, keep\r\nin mind that questions will range from very basic to more advanced.\r\nBeginners will have to be bold and ask the questions they have at\r\ntheir level (there are no stupid questions) and not be intimidated by\r\nmore advanced questions from more advanced users who are learning too.\r\nMore advanced users will have to \"remember when\", as they once were\r\nintroduced themselves to Linux, and hopefully contribute answers to\r\nbasic questions as well as more advanced ones.\r\n\r\n«You do not need to be a computer-wiz or a unix-guru to answer\r\nquestions on the list. Sometimes it is enough to be just 5 minutes\r\nahead of others to help them out.» (Quote from LBo -\r\nhttp://www.linuxbasics.org/mailinglist/start)\r\n\r\nRevising the Guide\r\n\r\nLBook along with all of LinuxBasics.org is on a wiki. If you wish to\r\nrevise something, you may first need to check out You Can Help in the\r\nHelp Section. You may also contribute by giving your suggestions and\r\nideas to us on the mailing list or send them to\r\nTheCrew@LinuxBasics.org.'

spam,'I know this letter may beat your imagination, as we\r\nhave no previous correspondence.\r\n\r\nWell i got your contact from my serious search for a\r\ngood profile foreigner and then i decided to write\r\nyou, after a very long time of indecision pondering to\r\nsee if i can confide in you. Please i will like you to\r\nbe as transparent and trustworthy to engage in this\r\nbusiness and assurrance that my own money must be\r\ngiven to me when this money is transfered to your\r\ncountry or account hence my reason for writing you. To\r\nintroduce myself, i am Prince Amanda Sese Seko one of\r\nthe sons of the late former President of Zaire Mobutu\r\nSese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Bang, so now i will like\r\nto do this transaction with you as someone who have\r\nbeen into production. My father the late president\r\nMobutu Sese Seko made the sum of $18,000,000 USD in\r\ncash, he tactically defaced this money and stashed\r\nthem in a security trunk box in order to enable him\r\nmove the money out of Zairien shores just as the rebel\r\nforces close by. Because of his political power and\r\ninfluence he succeeded and deposited this money in a\r\nsecurity company in Dakar-Senegal. But unfortunately\r\nfor him he died of cancer in Casablanca,Morroco, since\r\nhis death the present government has consficated all\r\nhis properties because of this i decided to travel to\r\nSenegal where my last hope lies and where i am\r\ncurrently living. This money in question has been in\r\nthe security company since my fathers death uptil this\r\nmoment.But my main problem now is at my age of 30\r\nyears i have never handled such huge amount of\r\nmoney,iam confused on how to handle this huge amount\r\nof money and also what to do with it as i don\'t have\r\nanyone to confide in here in Dakar-Senegal. May i\r\ntherefore use this medium to request from you if you\r\nwill be disposed enough to help me keep this huge\r\namount of money in your country or any other place of\r\nyour choice. I intend to invest this money on any\r\nprofitable business venture. I have met with and held\r\ndiscussion with the security company showed them the\r\ndepositional documents which my father left behind of\r\nwhich my name appeared as the next of kin,the company\r\nawaits my coming for the withdrawal and iam afraid of\r\ndisclosing the contents to them since my father\r\nstrictly warned me against that. Surprisingly for me\r\nthe chemist who dyed the bills for my father lives in\r\nDakar. He will also do the cleansing i have his\r\ntelephone number but not his address. If it appeals to\r\nyou to help me, i suggest you take a trip to Senegal\r\nfor us to see face to face and arrange with the\r\nchemist man for him to do the cleansing before moving\r\nthe fund to where ever that may be nominated by you.\r\nIf all goes well 20\% of the total amount will be for\r\nyou. For the confirmation of your willingness to\r\nassist me.'
