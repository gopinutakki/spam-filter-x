Hello Sir,

May I know when you will be at your office, so that I can return the Printed papers you gave me for the modification.
I believe you have asked for returning them, when I am done.

I you will not be at your office then I can Scan them as a PDF file and then send it to you (on Saturday as the computer labs will only open from Saturday).
