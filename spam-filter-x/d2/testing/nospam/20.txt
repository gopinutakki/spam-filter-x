Hello Gopi, this is Charles and my partner is Kevin. We are really
behind in our robot project and we could really use your help. We are
basically trying to have one of our robots communicate with the other by
distance. We want robot1 to move forward if and only if robot2 is close
to it. I believe this needs wifi am I correct? Is this possible?
Next if we can get that to work, we then want use Strabo so that the two
robots will know the dimensions of the room and where all of the objects
are. With this knowledge, robot1 will then "run away" from robot2 until
it is caught while robot2 will "chase" robot1 until it catches it. Think
of two children running after each other in a room until one catches the
other.
So again:
1.)Make robot1 move when robot2 is close to it
2.)Make robot1 change direction in the room that will keep it from being
caught
3.)Make robot2 chase after robot1
4.)Make both robots stop when robot2 touches robot1
Is this possible and can you help us please.
Please feel free to call me at any time on my cell 615 491 8053
And can you give me your cell number as well? THANK YOU!
