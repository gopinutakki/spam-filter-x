I am Deacon David Donka a member of Spring of Life Ministries Inc. I was
formerly into the importation and sale of medical equipment in my native
country Sierra Leone.  My operational base was in Freetown the capital
city. In January 1999, when the second civil war broke out in my country,
the Revolutionary United Front Rebels, who invaded Freetown, burned my
office and warehouse. In that attack, I lost all my properties and assets.
I was left with virtually nothing, except some money I had in the Bank.

When the United Nations sent in
troops to quell the rebel's onslaught and there was a
relative peace in Freetown, I returned to business,
but this time, I invested my resources in the Mining
of Diamond through the help of a third party,
some Lebanese who were very much versed in the
industry to Antwerp in Belgium.

The returns I got from this business were quite good and my life was
gradually picking up again until early this year when the Sierra-Leonean
government banned private exportation of the Diamond at the international
market. The U.N. obliged the government and it is now illegal to sell/buy
Diamond emanating from Sierra-Leone. Following this action, the government
of my country clamped down on all businessmen who had made fortunes
selling Diamond.

Consequently, my newly acquired properties were seized again and I had no
option than to leave the country immediately to a neighboring west African
country, where I met our Lord Jesus Christ and my life was totally
transformed. But before I left I was able to first move my money out of
the country. I had $10,500,000 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) in my domiciliary account in Freetown. I had to move the
money out of the Country through a very secret arranged channel, in a very
unconventional method this was done by my friend an official at the
Security Minting & Printing Company of my country. Presently, this money
is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm.

My ministry is basically a prayer and deliverance ministry. Since I
received my calling and joined my ministry, I have been asking God to
purify what remains of my wealth for evangelical works and for orphanage.
On the last day of a special fasting and praying session in my ministry,
there was a divine revelation from God that I should invest in your
ministry. My God is not an author of confusion, contact me immediately for
further discussions.
