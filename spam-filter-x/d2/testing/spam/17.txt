I was a Personal Assistant to
the Late Congo President, LURENT KABILA, who was
assasinated in February and my aim of writing to you
is because of the need for a trusted and honest
person, who I can entrust the sum of US$62,800,000
(Sixty two million, eight hundred thousand
USDollars).
 Source of the money: I and the late president secured
this money in a security firm in Ghana, in my name
 before his death.  Now that he is late, I want to
 transfer the money out of Africa, for investment in
your
 country, I can not travel out of Nigeria where I am
on
asylum, hence I am asking for your assistance to have
this money in your care pending when I will secure
travel documents to come over to your country.If you
accept this offer we shall share the money as follows:
for you,
25%, 75% for me.
