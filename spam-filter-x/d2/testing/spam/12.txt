My father the late president
Mobutu Sese Seko made the sum of $18,000,000 USD in
cash, he tactically defaced this money and stashed
them in a security trunk box in order to enable him
move the money out of Zairien shores just as the rebel
forces close by. I intend to invest this money on any
profitable business venture. I have met with and held
discussion with the security company showed them the
depositional documents which my father left behind of
which my name appeared as the next of kin,the company
awaits my coming for the withdrawal and iam afraid of
disclosing the contents to them since my father
strictly warned me against that.

If all goes well 20% of the total amount will be for
you. For the confirmation of your willingness to
assist me.
