This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the
total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70%
for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%
safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality.
