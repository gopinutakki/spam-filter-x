The intended business is thus, we had a customer, a 
Foreigner (a Turkish) resident in Abidjan, and he was a 
Contractor with one of the Government Paratatales.
He had in his Account in my branch the sum of US$35 Million 
{Thirty five Million U.S. Dollars). Unfortunately, the man 
died four years ago
until today non of his next of kin has come Forward to 
claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration 
with two other top Officials of the bank have covered up 
the account all this while. 
 
For your assistance we have agreed to give you thirty 
percent (30%) of the total sum at the end of the 
transaction. It is risk free and a big fortune for both of 
us. With your maximum co-operation, this transaction is not 
expected to last for more than 10 working days.
