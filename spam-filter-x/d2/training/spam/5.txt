We want to transfer ($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States
Dollars from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to oversea account. First,
I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by
virtue of it's nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have
confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of
this great magnitude.

We will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000]. Upon
successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of 20 million to your
account.

The total amount involved is Twenty six million United States Dollars only
[$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account
abroad before the rest.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties
might have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email
