I AM FORMER MRS. MARYAM ABACHA AND NOW MRS.MARY ABACHA A WIDOW TO LATE
GENERAL SANI ABACHA.

I INHERITED ALL MY HUSBAND'S WEALTH .WHICH I INTEND TO SHARE OUT PART OF
IT AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARITY HOMES IN DIFFERENT PART
OF THE WORLD FOR MOTHERLESS CHILDREN IN RELIEF ORGANISATIONS, RESEARCH
CENTRES FOR CANCER,CHURCHES FOR EVAGELISATION, IMPOVERISHED FAMILIES IN
THE WORLD.  YOUR NAME WAS SELECTED ALONG WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONS &
INDIVIDUALS TO BENEFIT FROM THIS FUND. IN WHICH I WILL DONATE THE SUM OF
US$4.5 MILLION(FOUR MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. UNITED STATE DOLLARS)
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR ORGANISATION AND FOR THE LESS PRIVILEDGE.

LASTLY, I HONESTLY HOPE THAT THIS MONEY WHEN TRANSFERED WILL BE USED FOR
THE PURPOSE IT IS MEANT FOR, BECAUSE I KNOW NOW THAT WEALTH WITHOUT CHRIST
IS VANITY UPON VANITY AND IF YOU HAVE TO DIE SAYS THE LORD, KEEP FIT AND I
WILL GIVE YOU THE CROWN OF LIFE.
