After  a  serious thought ,I find it pertinent to reach you directly 
and personally through this medium.
I'm the Deputy Governor of  the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). As the 
Apex Bank, I'm responsible for all wire transfers within the Central 
Bank of Nigeria and all affiliated Commercial Banks in the Country.

For justice and fair play, I'm compelled to contact you directly 
considering the pressure, threat, and blackmail directed to my person  by  a

now suspended attorney here in Nigeria over my refusal to grant a 
remittance authority  to  his  client and the African Development Bank in 
Particular where an indigene of your Country that lost his life with the 
entire family in a ghastly motor accident  has a credit balance of 
USD$35Million  with the above mentioned Bank.

Everything will be over within 7 working days. For reasons best known 
to me, as it also affect my office, I have decided to reach you through 
the internet until I get your interest indicated. I will give you a 
confidential phone and fax numbers for easy communication on the 
directives.

Sharing modalities: You will part with 35% of this sum including any 
other amount you may spend. Your prompt response is needed.
