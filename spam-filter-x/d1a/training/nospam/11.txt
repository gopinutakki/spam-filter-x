Hi Gopi!
 
Since it is clear you do not have any time for the SSLab product, it would seem to make sense for you to jump ahead into fixing up all the WKU robots that need attention in the AI Lab, as well as at the Business Accelerator.
 
I am sending you and Doug a message, copying Dr. Shindhelm, Joe Monti, and Justin, to do what I can to help move that process forward.  Your suggestions and thoughts on doing that would be most helpful, if the process I will describe in that message does not work for you.
 
Please let me know.
 
My other message will come in a few moments.
 
Thanks.
 
Yours,
Joe
