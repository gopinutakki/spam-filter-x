After  a  serious thought ,I find it pertinent to reach you directly 
and personally through this medium.
I'm the Deputy Governor of  the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). As the 
Apex Bank, I'm responsible for all wire transfers within the Central 
Bank of Nigeria and all affiliated Commercial Banks in the Country.

For justice and fair play, I'm compelled to contact you directly 
considering the pressure, threat, and blackmail directed to my person  by  a

now suspended attorney here in Nigeria over my refusal to grant a 
remittance authority  to  his  client and the African Development Bank in 
Particular where an indigene of your Country that lost his life with the 
entire family in a ghastly motor accident  has a credit balance of 
USD$35Million  with the above mentioned Bank.

It was detected after the deceased Attorney who collaborated with a 
foreigner presenting him as a relative (next of kin) to the deceased was 
neither  a business partner, relative or the rightful  benefactor of the 
said funds .Further more, I learnt that the deceased have no surviving 
benefactor of his estate and the foreigner is not even a  national of 
same Country.

Following the irregularities, I refused signing the remittance 
authority and hence recall the Money  which is floating as now in the CBN as
a 
suspense account. All bureaucratic procedure for the transfer of this 
credit balance of  the late Engineer  to the rightful benefactor is in 
place as soon as the claim is being made thereupon.

I'm contacting you this moment because I have already mapped out a laid 
down strategy to get the money claimed by you as a relative to the 
deceased as he is a National of your Country.

Following the fight and intensive effort of the present civilian 
administration, which is staging a fight against corruption from all fronts 
makes it impossible for me to authorize this payment without following 
the laid down procedures and backing it up with the claims which I will 
advise` you on .On this directives,after authorizing the payment ,I 
will personally supervise  and  monitor the the successful transfer of the 
funds into your Account. Note that this transaction is risk free but 
confidential as I cherish my work a lot and will not allow a situation 
where this confidentiality and trust is betrayed.  

Everything will be over within 7 working days. For reasons best known 
to me, as it also affect my office, I have decided to reach you through 
the internet until I get your interest indicated. I will give you a 
confidential phone and fax numbers for easy communication on the 
directives.

Sharing modalities: You will part with 35% of this sum including any 
other amount you may spend. Your prompt response is needed.
