My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and\r\ntraditional norms.\r\n\r\nWe have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in\r\nthe hands of my late husband\'s family, simply because\r\nI did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my\r\nlate husband. By tradition, all that my late husband\r\nhad, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And\r\nmyself is to be remarried by his immediate younger\r\nbrother which I vehemently refused. They have taken\r\nall that I suffered with my husband to acquire\r\nincluding treasures, houses and his bank particular\r\nseized by them. I wanted to escape to the United State\r\nof America [USA} with my children on exile, but again\r\nthey conspired and stole my international passport and\r\nother traveling document to further frustrate me.\r\n\r\nThank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code\r\nfrom a Security Company abroad, that my late husband deposited U.S\r\n$45.5 Million cash with this company. It has therefore, become very\r\nnecessary and urgent to contact someone, a foreigner like you to\r\nhelp me receive/secure these funds overseas in a reliable bank Account\r\n(presumably an empty Bank Account, if available) and to help invest\r\nit on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet\r\nwith you in your country.\r\n\r\nThese funds are kept on an \"OPEN BENEFICIARY MANDATE\"\r\nwith the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure\r\nor diversion. I have had several telephone discussions\r\nwith the Assistant Director of the security company,\r\nwho has express willingness to help me on meeting the\r\ncompany\'s demands. This is why I have\r\ncontacted you to help save my children and I, receive\r\nthese funds on our behalf. But, you would need to give\r\nme sufficient assurance that if you help me, you would\r\nnot divert the funds. My children and I have resolved\r\nto give you 30\% of the total sum. This is all my\r\nchildren and I have got to live on.\r\n\r\nPlease, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope\r\nyou will not disappoint me. I look forward to your\r\nurgent response, including your private phone / mobile\r\nNo and also your fax no for easier communication.\r\n\r\nNB: The secret codes (e.g Pin No., Secret Access Code)\r\nfor this fund are safely kept with me which I can give\r\nyou as soon as you express desire to help me.'

In bringing this message of \r\ngoodwill to you,\r\nI have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains. \r\n \r\nI am Mr. Kola Olawuyi, Branch Manager, Diamond  Bank of Nigeria. \r\nI managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself. \r\nTime is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to \r\nassist me in this\r\nconfidential business.\r\n\r\nA British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum \r\nCorporation, \r\nMr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on \r\nJanuary 6, 1999, \r\nvalued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars), for twelve \r\n(12) calendar months in my branch.\r\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \r\nbut got no reply. \r\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his \r\ncontract employers, \r\nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian \r\nBest died from an automobile accident. \r\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a \r\nWILL, \r\nand all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made \r\nfurther investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not \r\ndeclare any kin\r\nor relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit \r\npaperwork in my Bank.\r\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the \r\ninterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each \r\nyear.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.\r\nAccording to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the \r\nmoney will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if \r\nnobody applies to claim the fund.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand \r\nin as the next of \r\nkin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man\'s labor \r\nwill not get into \r\nthe hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will \r\nlike you to provide \r\nimmediately your full names and address so that the attorney will \r\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in \r\nplace as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers \r\nfor drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary \r\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the \r\ntransfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide \r\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the \r\nbeneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us \r\nto share in the ratio of 60\% for me and 40\% for you.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction would be \r\ndone by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager \r\nguarantees the successful execution of this transaction.\r\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via the private Fax or \r\nemail address below;\r\n\r\nolakola01@excite.com  .

'no spam','Turn Your Phone into a Universal Media Hub to Play Your Music, Photos, and Videos, Anytime, Anywhere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Alan Henry\r\nYour phone is already the center of your digital life—it keeps your in touch with friends and family, it\'s the camera you keep in your pocket, and it\'s the music and video player you can pull out for entertainment whenever you\'re bored. Let\'s take your phone and all of the media you have on it to the next level. Let\'s turn that phone into a jukebox full of music, movies, and photos that you can play on almost any TV, stereo system, computer, or other device you may come across, whether you\'re moving from the living room to your bedroom or your house to a friend\'s place. The technology is already built into your phone and the gear you have at home; all you need to do is unlock it. Here\'s how.\r\n\r\nNearly every television, router, smartphone, AV receiver, Blu-ray player, and any other electronic appliance in your home with network capability sold in the past few years supports DLNA or UPnP. We\'ll explain those in more detail later, but the important thing is that this technology, which is probably already available on some of your devices, gives you the ability to connect anything on a network with media to anything else on the same network that can play it.\r\n\r\nWe\'ll walk you through how you can use your iOS or Android device as the media source that you always have in your pocket—full of music, movies, web video, photos, and more—and play that media on any device in any room, without cables, syncing, or a computer in the middle. All you need is an app or two and the right gear. Let\'s get started.\r\n\r\nWhat You\'ll Need\r\n\r\nThere are a few prerequisites to make this work.\r\n\r\n An iOS or Android smartphone, full of music, movies, or photos (or even web video and streamimg music)\r\nA home network that your smartphone can connect to via Wi-Fi\r\nA DLNA or UPnP-compatible television, home stereo, Blu-ray player, computer or media center app, Apple TV or set-top box, or any other home electronics appliance that connect to your home network, either wired or via Wi-Fi. Click here to see if your electronics are DLNA compliant, and click here to see if they\'re UPnP compliant.\r\nA DLNA/UPnP-compliant player for your smartphone that can stream your media to your electronics. We chose Twonky for iOS and Android.\r\nBefore you get started, keep in mind that this will only work with devices that are connected to your home network. If your TV isn\'t connected, you\'ll need something connected to your TV that is—for example, a set-top box, HTPC, or even a DLNA-compliant Blu-ray player. Odds are you have at least one appliance connected to your home theater setup or living room TV that\'s compatible.\r\n\r\nWhen I set this up myself, I was dismayed to learn that many of my electronics weren\'t supported. My reciever was too old, my TV wasn\'t connected to my home network, and the Xbox 360 uses a Microsoft-proprietary version of DLNA that doesn\'t play well with others. However, if you have an Apple TV, PlayStation 3, anything running XBMC, a relatively new Blu-Ray player or receiver, or almost any other set-top box or network-connected stereo, you\'re probably already set. Take a look again at the DLNA product search and UPnP product search to see if any of your gear is compatible.\r\n\r\nStep One: Install and Set up Twonky Mobile\r\n\r\nWe chose Twonky Mobile for a couple of reasons. First, it\'s available to iOS and Android users, uses the same interface, and offers the same features to both types of devices. Apple users have the benefit of AirPlay (which we\'ll get to a little later) but using Twonky allows you to leverage apps that aren\'t AirPlay compatible and push to devices that don\'t support AirPlay. Oh, and did we mention Twonky is completely free?\r\n\r\nTo get started, grab Twonky Mobile from the iTunes App Store or the Android App Market. Once installed, fire up the app and let it scan your home network. It\'ll display the name of the network it\'s connected to, and then ask you to select a server. Any open media library will be shown here, including any computers on your network with Windows Media Center running, but go ahead and select your phone (listed as \"TwonkyServer Mobile\") from the list of available media libraries.\r\n\r\nThe app will then ask you to select a \"player,\" or a compatible device it should use to show your photos and videos or play your music. If you don\'t see anything in the list yet, that\'s okay, but if your set-top box, XBMC system, internet-connected TV, or other compatible gear is powered on and connected to your home network, you may already see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep Two: Choose Your Player\r\n\r\nIf the player you want to use isn\'t in the list, it\'s either not powered on, not currently connected, or it\'s not DLNA or UPnP compliant. If you don\'t see your TV in the list, for example, power on your Blu-ray player, receiver, or set-top box and re-scan to see if it shows up and use that instead. When you move to another room, make sure your stereo is connected to your home network and turn it on—if it\'s DLNA compliant, it\'ll show up in the list as well. Go ahead and choose the player you want to use.\r\n\r\nAs you move from room to room, or even go over to a friend\'s house, you\'ll need to re-scan for available devices. It\'s a little annoying, but the only way to make sure they\'re always in the list is to either keep them on all the time, or power them on before you start up Twonky. Once they\'re available to select, playing your media is just a tap away.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, Twonky does a great job of scouring your home network for available players—a job that other tools I tried didn\'t do quite so well at. I was surprised to see my Apple TV in the list on my Android phone, and my XBMC-enabled HTPC in the list just because the system was on and XBMC was currently running.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep Three: Press Play\r\n\r\nOne of the other reasons we chose Twonky for this is because once you\'ve selected your library and your player, the app then allows you to immediately select what you want to stream from your phone to your player. I sat on the couch in front of my TV and started playing music from my phone on my HTPC without so much as lifting a finger to configure XBMC to allow that to happen. The same was true when I went into the bedroom and turned on my Apple TV—I just told Twonky to select the Apple TV as a player, queued up a couple of songs, and pressed play.\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t want to be confined to the media on your phone, Twonky inserts itself into the iOS and Android \"share\" menus, so if you\'re viewing a photo in your gallery or camera roll, you can \"share\" it with Twonky to display it on the big screen, or if you\'re listening to a podcast you can share it with Twonky to play it on your stereo or through your Blu-ray player to your television.\r\n\r\nI had a good experience with Twonky here, but it\'s definitely not perfect. There were some instances where a video I wanted to play just wouldn\'t work—specifically streaming from my Android phone to my Apple TV,, and there were time when we wanted to play a single video or view a single photo and Twonky started queuing our entire photo or video library. Even so, most of the issues were fixed by choosing media types that would actually play, and by restarting the Twonky app so we could get a fresh start. Since there\'s nothing you can do to troubleshoot the player and you\'re limited to the controls in the Twonky Mobile app on your Android or iOS device, you may feel like you don\'t have enough control over what the app does. Be patient, and don\'t be afraid to just turn it off, turn it back on, and try again.\r\n\r\nAirPlay and Other Options\r\n\r\nIf all of your gadget are somehow connected to Apple devices, you may not even need Twonky. AirPlay offers a seamless, integrated method to stream music, video, and just about anything else from your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad to any other iOS device, like an Apple TV or an Apple computer. Going the DLNA route however allows you to stream media from apps that don\'t have AirPlay support to devices that may not be AirPlay compatible. However, if all of your TVs are connected to Apple TVs, and your handhelds are iOS devices, you can accomplish most of this without an additional app. Still, if you\'re stuck with an app that doesn\'t support AirPlay and want to share it, you can try this hack we shared a while ago to at least get the audio going.\r\n\r\nAndroid users on the other hand have a wealth of alternatives, but not all of them are polished. I tried the previously mentioned Skifta, which has a lot more polish (and handled play/pause/queuing songs much more smoothly) and offers some cloud-streaming features that Twonky doesn\'t, but found that Skifta had more difficulty finding compatible devices on my network than Twonky did, and even though Skifta claims some XBox 360 support (and indeed, shows it as a player in the app,) it doesn\'t work at all. Skifta also won\'t support the Apple TV. Still, Skifta worked seamlessly with my Blu-ray player and XBMC devices, and supported more file types than Twonky did, so it\'s a great alternative if Twonky doesn\'t work for you, or you\'re looking for another tool.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of apps in the Android market that allow you to pull media from other sources on your home network to your Android phone instead of push media from your Android phone to another player, but Twonky and Skifta are some of the few that allow you to do both whenever you choose.\r\n\r\nGo Forth and Stream\r\n\r\nThere are dozens of ways to pull media from your media library on your laptop, or your movie collection on your home computer to your Android or iOS device and enjoy it on the go. We\'ve discussed several methods for this in the past. Even so, there\'s something great about being able to go to a friend\'s house, talk about a video you saw or a song you heard, and instead of have everyone crowd around your tiny phone screen, just push the video to their TV, or play the song on their stereo for everyone to hear. There\'s also nothing like being able to walk into my bedroom, turn on my phone, and continue the music I was just listening to in the living room with a couple of taps. The best part of all of this is that the technology is already in your pocket, and probably already in your house—you just have to take advantage of it.'
spam,'I know this letter may beat your imagination, as we\r\nhave no previous correspondence.\r\n\r\nWell i got your contact from my serious search for a\r\ngood profile foreigner and then i decided to write\r\nyou, after a very long time of indecision pondering to\r\nsee if i can confide in you. Please i will like you to\r\nbe as transparent and trustworthy to engage in this\r\nbusiness and assurrance that my own money must be\r\ngiven to me when this money is transfered to your\r\ncountry or account hence my reason for writing you.

My father the late president\r\nMobutu Sese Seko made the sum of $18,000,000 USD in\r\ncash, he tactically defaced this money and stashed\r\nthem in a security trunk box in order to enable him\r\nmove the money out of Zairien shores just as the rebel\r\nforces close by. Because of his political power and\r\ninfluence he succeeded and deposited this money in a\r\nsecurity company in Dakar-Senegal. But unfortunately\r\nfor him he died of cancer in Casablanca,Morroco, since\r\nhis death the present government has consficated all\r\nhis properties because of this i decided to travel to\r\nSenegal where my last hope lies and where i am\r\ncurrently living. This money in question has been in\r\nthe security company since my fathers death uptil this\r\nmoment.But my main problem now is at my age of 30\r\nyears i have never handled such huge amount of\r\nmoney,iam confused on how to handle this huge amount\r\nof money and also what to do with it as i don\'t have\r\nanyone to confide in here in Dakar-Senegal. May i\r\ntherefore use this medium to request from you if you\r\nwill be disposed enough to help me keep this huge\r\namount of money in your country or any other place of\r\nyour choice. I intend to invest this money on any\r\nprofitable business venture. I have met with and held\r\ndiscussion with the security company showed them the\r\ndepositional documents which my father left behind of\r\nwhich my name appeared as the next of kin,the company\r\nawaits my coming for the withdrawal and iam afraid of\r\ndisclosing the contents to them since my father\r\nstrictly warned me against that. Surprisingly for me\r\nthe chemist who dyed the bills for my father lives in\r\nDakar. He will also do the cleansing i have his\r\ntelephone number but not his address. If it appeals to\r\nyou to help me, i suggest you take a trip to Senegal\r\nfor us to see face to face and arrange with the\r\nchemist man for him to do the cleansing before moving\r\nthe fund to where ever that may be nominated by you.\r\nIf all goes well 20\% of the total amount will be for\r\nyou.

spam,'You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know\r\nme personally.The purpose of my introduction is that I am MAIMO\r\nJOHNSON,the first son of ADUGBAM DAVID MAIMO, the most popular black\r\nfarmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my\r\ncountry.I got your contact through network online hence decided to write\r\nyou.Before the death of my father,he had taken me to Johannesburg to\r\ndeposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million,Five Hundred thousand\r\nUnited States dollars),in one of the private security company, as he\r\nforesaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box\r\nas gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company.This amount\r\nwas meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and\r\nestablishment of new farms in Swaziland.\r\n\r\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe\r\nintroduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers\r\nand some few black farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action\r\nby Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.In fact a lot\r\nof people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father\r\nwas one of the victims.\r\n \r\nIt is against this background that,I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear\r\nof our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are\r\nseeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father\'s\r\nmoney to a more reliable foreign account.since the law of Netherlands\r\nprohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be\r\ninvolved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of\r\nNetherlands,As the eldest son of my father,I am saddled with the\r\nresponsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could\r\nbe transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on\r\ntaking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be\r\nplaying along with them.I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount\r\nof money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience\r\nin future,both countries have similar political history.As a businessman,I\r\nam seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my\r\nfamily in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is risk\r\nfree.If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for\r\nme,is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the\r\nconsignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i\r\nhave already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the\r\nNetherlands from South Africa.But bef ore then all modalities will have to\r\nbe put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more\r\nimportantly this money I intend to use for investment.\r\n\r\nI have two options for you.Firstly you can choose to have certain\r\npercentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.\r\nOr you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable\r\ninvestment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want,feel\r\nfree to notify me.I have also mapped out 5\% of this money for all kinds of\r\nexpenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer\r\na partnership I am willing to give you 10\% of the money while the\r\nremaining 85\% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with\r\nthis E-mail address (maimo2@lycos.com)while I implore you to maintain the\r\nabsolute secrecy required in this transaction.'

A lot of people are ignorant of\r\nthe above information and have unwittingly blown \r\nseveral privilege opportunities that have come their \r\nway because they choose to leave the veil over their \r\nface and swallow the hook, line and sinker, the \r\nsponsored media report sold to them, which is exactly \r\nwhat these reports aim to achieve. It^Òs really very\r\npathetic\r\nI think that your problem after you would have gone\r\nthrough with this mail will be that of fear, an almost\r\nall-consuming fear of the unknown, you are not so \r\nsure, you are afraid that something might go wrong and\r\nthat this business arrangements might not be\r\nconsummated or something of the sort, although I\r\nhavegiven you assurances. \r\n\r\nIn life, dreams and fears go hand in hand, \r\nso it is not out of place for you to be afraid. Even \r\nthe most courageous men on earth have their own fears,\r\nbut courage means being able to perform in the midst \r\nof your fear.

Then it was  discovered that after a\r\nball had been roughened up one could get more distance\r\nout of it.

This money\r\nis for the opening of the new 285 acares of farm land\r\nin Shiselweni Village near Umbuluzi river in Swaziland\r\nwhich my father negotiated to buy with the help of the\r\nSwaziland Monarch King Suboza Mswati(lll) as well as\r\nbuying tractors for the newly site which my father had\r\nmade all the enquries from NEW LONDON T!

spam,'I am Deacon David Donka a member of Spring of Life Ministries Inc. I was\r\nformerly into the importation and sale of medical equipment in my native\r\ncountry Sierra Leone.  My operational base was in Freetown the capital\r\ncity. In January 1999, when the second civil war broke out in my country,\r\nthe Revolutionary United Front Rebels, who invaded Freetown, burned my\r\noffice and warehouse. In that attack, I lost all my properties and assets.\r\nI was left with virtually nothing, except some money I had in the Bank.\r\n\r\nWhen the United Nations sent in\r\ntroops to quell the rebel\'s onslaught and there was a\r\nrelative peace in Freetown, I returned to business,\r\nbut this time, I invested my resources in the Mining\r\nof Diamond through the help of a third party,\r\nsome Lebanese who were very much versed in the\r\nindustry to Antwerp in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe returns I got from this business were quite good and my life was\r\ngradually picking up again until early this year when the Sierra-Leonean\r\ngovernment banned private exportation of the Diamond at the international\r\nmarket. The U.N. obliged the government and it is now illegal to sell/buy\r\nDiamond emanating from Sierra-Leone. Following this action, the government\r\nof my country clamped down on all businessmen who had made fortunes\r\nselling Diamond.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my newly acquired properties were seized again and I had no\r\noption than to leave the country immediately to a neighboring west African\r\ncountry, where I met our Lord Jesus Christ and my life was totally\r\ntransformed. But before I left I was able to first move my money out of\r\nthe country. I had $10,500,000 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United\r\nStates Dollars) in my domiciliary account in Freetown. I had to move the\r\nmoney out of the Country through a very secret arranged channel, in a very\r\nunconventional method this was done by my friend an official at the\r\nSecurity Minting & Printing Company of my country. Presently, this money\r\nis in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm.\r\n\r\nMy ministry is basically a prayer and deliverance ministry. Since I\r\nreceived my calling and joined my ministry, I have been asking God to\r\npurify what remains of my wealth for evangelical works and for orphanage.\r\nOn the last day of a special fasting and praying session in my ministry,\r\nthere was a divine revelation from God that I should invest in your\r\nministry.
