My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and\r\ntraditional norms.\r\n\r\nWe have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in\r\nthe hands of my late husband\'s family, simply because\r\nI did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my\r\nlate husband. By tradition, all that my late husband\r\nhad, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And\r\nmyself is to be remarried by his immediate younger\r\nbrother which I vehemently refused. They have taken\r\nall that I suffered with my husband to acquire\r\nincluding treasures, houses and his bank particular\r\nseized by them. I wanted to escape to the United State\r\nof America [USA} with my children on exile, but again\r\nthey conspired and stole my international passport and\r\nother traveling document to further frustrate me.\r\n\r\nThank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code\r\nfrom a Security Company abroad, that my late husband deposited U.S\r\n$45.5 Million cash with this company.

spam,'I am Deacon David Donka a member of Spring of Life Ministries Inc. I was\r\nformerly into the importation and sale of medical equipment in my native\r\ncountry Sierra Leone.  My operational base was in Freetown the capital\r\ncity. In January 1999, when the second civil war broke out in my country,\r\nthe Revolutionary United Front Rebels, who invaded Freetown, burned my\r\noffice and warehouse. In that attack, I lost all my properties and assets.\r\nI was left with virtually nothing, except some money I had in the Bank.\r\n\r\nWhen the United Nations sent in\r\ntroops to quell the rebel\'s onslaught and there was a\r\nrelative peace in Freetown, I returned to business,\r\nbut this time, I invested my resources in the Mining\r\nof Diamond through the help of a third party,\r\nsome Lebanese who were very much versed in the\r\nindustry to Antwerp in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe returns I got from this business were quite good and my life was\r\ngradually picking up again until early this year when the Sierra-Leonean\r\ngovernment banned private exportation of the Diamond at the international\r\nmarket. The U.N. obliged the government and it is now illegal to sell/buy\r\nDiamond emanating from Sierra-Leone. Following this action, the government\r\nof my country clamped down on all businessmen who had made fortunes\r\nselling Diamond.\r\n\r\nConsequently, my newly acquired properties were seized again and I had no\r\noption than to leave the country immediately to a neighboring west African\r\ncountry, where I met our Lord Jesus Christ and my life was totally\r\ntransformed. But before I left I was able to first move my money out of\r\nthe country. I had $10,500,000 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United\r\nStates Dollars) in my domiciliary account in Freetown. I had to move the\r\nmoney out of the Country through a very secret arranged channel, in a very\r\nunconventional method this was done by my friend an official at the\r\nSecurity Minting & Printing Company of my country. Presently, this money\r\nis in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm.\r\n\r\nMy ministry is basically a prayer and deliverance ministry. Since I\r\nreceived my calling and joined my ministry, I have been asking God to\r\npurify what remains of my wealth for evangelical works and for orphanage.\r\nOn the last day of a special fasting and praying session in my ministry,\r\nthere was a divine revelation from God that I should invest in your\r\nministry. My God is not an author of confusion, contact me immediately for\r\nfurther discussions.'

I must reiterate\r\nhowever that you must not swallow hook, line and\r\nsinker all that you have been told or read.\r\nWe are aware of these reports about scam which most\r\nAfrican countries have been famed for such activities.\r\n\r\nMy dear, the truth is that many people remain poor in \r\nlife today by virtue of their ignorance of certain \r\nprivilege information. A lot of people are ignorant of\r\nthe above information and have unwittingly blown \r\nseveral privilege opportunities that have come their \r\nway because they choose to leave the veil over their \r\nface and swallow the hook, line and sinker, the \r\nsponsored media report sold to them, which is exactly \r\nwhat these reports aim to achieve. It^Òs really very\r\npathetic\r\nI think that your problem after you would have gone\r\nthrough with this mail will be that of fear, an almost\r\nall-consuming fear of the unknown, you are not so \r\nsure, you are afraid that something might go wrong and\r\nthat this business arrangements might not be\r\nconsummated or something of the sort, although I\r\nhavegiven you assurances. \r\n\r\nIn life, dreams and fears go hand in hand, \r\nso it is not out of place for you to be afraid. Even \r\nthe most courageous men on earth have their own fears,\r\nbut courage means being able to perform in the midst \r\nof your fear. It is said that an individual cannot \r\ndiscover new ocean until he has the courage to lose\r\nsight of the shores. \r\nPlease I advise you to be courageous in this \r\ntransaction and lets go ahead with this transaction. \r\nEverything will work out very well to our ultimate \r\nmutual advantage. Do not fear or despair, as our \r\ntransaction has no bearing or any relation with scam, \r\nwe presently have found ourselves (men of great hope \r\nand aspiration) in the most trying times where because\r\nof insufficient resources, little minds tend to spite \r\nus, but there is a dawn of hope, we have toiled all \r\nnight, we can not give in to human dissuasions, \r\nhistory has a place for minds of steel. \r\nWhen they first manufactured golf balls , they  made \r\nthe cover smooth. Then it was  discovered that after a\r\nball had been roughened up one could get more distance\r\nout of it. So they started  manufacturing them with\r\ndimpled covers. \r\nSo it is with life, it takes some rough spots in your \r\nlife to make you go your farthest. \r\n\r\nMy name is Mr.PATRICK  KING ELSWORTH, the son of\r\nMr.Henry Elsworth of Kwekwe Zimbabwe.\r\nDuring the current war crisis against the farmers in\r\nZimbabwe from the support of President Robert Mugabe,\r\nbecause on his envy and greediness to claim all the\r\nwhite-owned farms for his party members and his\r\nfollowers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender\r\nall their farms(lands) to his party members and\r\nhis followers.\r\n\r\nMy father(Mr.Henry Elsworth of blessed memory) is\r\none of the best farmers in the country and because he\r\ndid not Support Robert Mugabe ideas, Mugabe^Òs order\r\nhis supporters to invaded my father\'s farm and burnt\r\neverything in the farm in asmuch as killing my beloved\r\nfather with two of his workers who was at the farm\r\nwith him and made away with a lot of items in my\r\nfather\'s farm.(19 Jan 2001,firday around 3.30 pm)\r\nBefore his death, my father deposited with a Security\r\nCompany in Amsterdam,Neitherland(Europe)the sum of\r\nUS$15.5Million}{Fifteen million Five hundred thousand\r\nUnited States Dollars}as family valuables. This money\r\nis for the opening of the new 285 acares of farm land\r\nin Shiselweni Village near Umbuluzi river in Swaziland\r\nwhich my father negotiated to buy with the help of the\r\nSwaziland Monarch King Suboza Mswati(lll) as well as\r\nbuying tractors for the newly site which my father had\r\nmade all the enquries from NEW LONDON T! RACTOR &\r\nEQUIPMENT. ROUTE 460 WEST OF LYNCHBURG LONDON. \r\n\r\nAfter the death of my father and the bread winner of\r\nthe family,I decided to move to the Fedearal Republic\r\nof Nigeria (as all my hopes is no longer )where my\r\nfather had deposited the Money in the Security Company\r\nas family valuables to withdraw it and put to use. My\r\nhopes was turn down as it is against the\r\nconstitutional human right law of Fedearal Republic of\r\nNigeria that asylums seeking refugee in their country\r\nto have an account with their banks or to have an\r\nenterprise in their country. This they showed me in\r\nGreen Paper on International Refugee(SECTION 22 ACT OF\r\nTHE REFUGEE ACT NO 13 OF 1998)prohibts it and failure\r\nto comply on this is against the SECTION 37(B1 and B9)\r\nof the Fedearal Republic of Nigeria laws which was in\r\nthe Agreement with United Nations High Commissionerfor\r\nRefugees (UNHCR) in 1993.\r\n\r\nAfter all this I decided to seek for an advice for on\r\nthe best way to retrieve this money(U.N.H.C.R)they\r\nadvised me that the best way is for me is to contact\r\nan oversea person so that he can help me because as\r\naslyum seekers here the human right law of the country\r\nwill not allow me to move this money overseas on my\r\nown capacity. So l decided to contact you so that you\r\ncan assist me to move this money out of Nigeria\r\nbecause as asylum seekers i am not allowed to operate\r\nany bank account within Nigeria. \r\nThis money I have intend to use for investment in your\r\ncountry.

The South African government seems to be\r\nplaying along with them.I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount\r\nof money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience\r\nin future,both countries have similar political history.As a businessman,I\r\nam seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my\r\nfamily in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is risk\r\nfree.If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for\r\nme,is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the\r\nconsignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i\r\nhave already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the\r\nNetherlands from South Africa.But bef ore then all modalities will have to\r\nbe put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more\r\nimportantly this money I intend to use for investment.\r\n\r\nI have two options for you.Firstly you can choose to have certain\r\npercentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.\r\nOr you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable\r\ninvestment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want,feel\r\nfree to notify me.I have also mapped out 5\% of this money for all kinds of\r\nexpenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer\r\na partnership I am willing to give you 10\% of the money while the\r\nremaining 85\% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with\r\nthis E-mail address (maimo2@lycos.com)while I implore you to maintain the\r\nabsolute secrecy required in this transaction.'

'no spam','LinuxBasics Course\r\n\r\nAn Introduction to Linux Basics\r\n\r\nLinuxBasic.org offers our second free Linux class, An Introduction to\r\nLinux Basics.\r\n\r\nLinux can certainly be used as a Desktop without much understanding of\r\nhow it works. This course is designed to give a foundation of\r\nunderstanding of Linux to a beginner who wants to know a little more\r\nabout the system. More advanced Linux users will find an opportunity\r\nto dig deeper into some areas they always wanted to know more about or\r\ndiscover gaps in their knowledge that they didn\'t know existed.\r\n\r\nWe will use LBook, our own edited version of \"Introduction to Linux: A\r\nHands on Guide\" by Machtelt Garrels, as a study guide. We are excited\r\nabout using this guide which is under the GNU Free Documentation\r\nLicensemeaning we can revise it. As we study this guide, we will\r\nupdate it together. We also intend to make an Answer Key for the\r\nexercises in the guide.\r\n\r\nOur heartfelt thanks go to Machtelt Garrels for creating the original\r\nguide and also to you who will join us in studying and revising it for\r\nthe LinuxBasics.org community.\r\n\r\nWhen, Where, How, and How Long\r\n\r\nThe class is set to begin on October 19, 2006. There 11 chapters and\r\nan Intro in the guide. We will spend more than a week on most chapters\r\nand anticipate the class running for about 6 months. A Schedule will\r\nbe posted.\r\n\r\nClass members will read the section for the week and do the exercises\r\nat the end of the chapters. Relevant questions and comments may then\r\nbe discussed on the mailing list; so you will need to join that in\r\norder to participate. See Mailing List page for information.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to introduce yourself on the list at the beginning of\r\nthe class. If you don\'t begin until after October 19, join the list,\r\nintroduce yourself and start with the first week\'s section. There is\r\nno rush to catch up to where others may be. You are free to discuss\r\nwherever you are in the guide or other Linux-related matters on the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nHow much does it cost? Basic requirements\r\n\r\nThis course is free (as in free beer). However, a goodwill\r\ncontribution in the form of active participation, revisions,\r\nsuggestions or ideas would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBasic requirements are a desire to learn, to do reasonable footwork\r\n(reading the material, googling the topics at times, gathering\r\ninformation on your own system), to respect fellow learners, and to\r\nfollow netetiquette. This course being more specifically targeted to\r\nbeginners, there aren\'t really that many requirements. However, keep\r\nin mind that questions will range from very basic to more advanced.\r\nBeginners will have to be bold and ask the questions they have at\r\ntheir level (there are no stupid questions) and not be intimidated by\r\nmore advanced questions from more advanced users who are learning too.\r\nMore advanced users will have to \"remember when\", as they once were\r\nintroduced themselves to Linux, and hopefully contribute answers to\r\nbasic questions as well as more advanced ones.\r\n\r\n«You do not need to be a computer-wiz or a unix-guru to answer\r\nquestions on the list. Sometimes it is enough to be just 5 minutes\r\nahead of others to help them out.» (Quote from LBo -\r\nhttp://www.linuxbasics.org/mailinglist/start)\r\n\r\nRevising the Guide\r\n\r\nLBook along with all of LinuxBasics.org is on a wiki. If you wish to\r\nrevise something, you may first need to check out You Can Help in the\r\nHelp Section. You may also contribute by giving your suggestions and\r\nideas to us on the mailing list or send them to\r\nTheCrew@LinuxBasics.org.'

Please i will like you to\r\nbe as transparent and trustworthy to engage in this\r\nbusiness and assurrance that my own money must be\r\ngiven to me when this money is transfered to your\r\ncountry or account hence my reason for writing you. To\r\nintroduce myself, i am Prince Amanda Sese Seko one of\r\nthe sons of the late former President of Zaire Mobutu\r\nSese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Bang, so now i will like\r\nto do this transaction with you as someone who have\r\nbeen into production. My father the late president\r\nMobutu Sese Seko made the sum of $18,000,000 USD in\r\ncash, he tactically defaced this money and stashed\r\nthem in a security trunk box in order to enable him\r\nmove the money out of Zairien shores just as the rebel\r\nforces close by. Because of his political power and\r\ninfluence he succeeded and deposited this money in a\r\nsecurity company in Dakar-Senegal. But unfortunately\r\nfor him he died of cancer in Casablanca,Morroco, since\r\nhis death the present government has consficated all\r\nhis properties because of this i decided to travel to\r\nSenegal where my last hope lies and where i am\r\ncurrently living. This money in question has been in\r\nthe security company since my fathers death uptil this\r\nmoment.But my main problem now is at my age of 30\r\nyears i have never handled such huge amount of\r\nmoney,iam confused on how to handle this huge amount\r\nof money and also what to do with it as i don\'t have\r\nanyone to confide in here in Dakar-Senegal. May i\r\ntherefore use this medium to request from you if you\r\nwill be disposed enough to help me keep this huge\r\namount of money in your country or any other place of\r\nyour choice. I intend to invest this money on any\r\nprofitable business venture. I have met with and held\r\ndiscussion with the security company showed them the\r\ndepositional documents which my father left behind of\r\nwhich my name appeared as the next of kin,the company\r\nawaits my coming for the withdrawal and iam afraid of\r\ndisclosing the contents to them since my father\r\nstrictly warned me against that. Surprisingly for me\r\nthe chemist who dyed the bills for my father lives in\r\nDakar. He will also do the cleansing i have his\r\ntelephone number but not his address. If it appeals to\r\nyou to help me, i suggest you take a trip to Senegal\r\nfor us to see face to face and arrange with the\r\nchemist man for him to do the cleansing before moving\r\nthe fund to where ever that may be nominated by you.\r\nIf all goes well 20\% of the total amount will be for\r\nyou.

In bringing this message of \r\ngoodwill to you,\r\nI have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains. \r\n \r\nI am Mr. Kola Olawuyi, Branch Manager, Diamond  Bank of Nigeria. \r\nI managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself. \r\nTime is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to \r\nassist me in this\r\nconfidential business.\r\n\r\nA British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum \r\nCorporation, \r\nMr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on \r\nJanuary 6, 1999, \r\nvalued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars), for twelve \r\n(12) calendar months in my branch.\r\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \r\nbut got no reply. \r\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his \r\ncontract employers, \r\nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian \r\nBest died from an automobile accident. \r\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a \r\nWILL, \r\nand all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made \r\nfurther investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not \r\ndeclare any kin\r\nor relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit \r\npaperwork in my Bank.\r\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the \r\ninterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each \r\nyear.

'no spam','Recalibrate Your Reality\r\n\r\nBy Thorin Klosowski\r\nWish you were better/smarter/stronger/faster? Sure, hard work helps, but the truth is, your self perception may be getting in the way. We all form our own realities, and those realities aren\'t perfect. Your self perception can be very limiting, and shaking up your notion of the world can do wonders for your productivity, creativity, and happiness. Here\'s how to recalibrate your reality.\r\n\r\nRemember the last time you lost confidence after your boss was disappointed in your workor maybe you were stood up by a friend? You second-guessed yourself after that, and ultimately your work or personal life suffered. The idea behind recalibrating your reality is pretty simple. When you get locked into a view of the world you get stuck in routines and you lose sight of different viewpoints. Recalibrating that view can help you solve problems, win arguments, and even be happier. But how do we actually do it? We\'ll take a look at a few of the different methods you can use to recalibrate your perception of the world and yourself, but first, we have to understand how we perceive the world to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe Basics of How We Perceive the World\r\n\r\nTo get a grasp on how we perceive the world, I talked with David Eagleman, neuroscientist at the Baylor College of Medicine and author of Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain and Timothy Wilson, psychologist at the University of Virginia and author of Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Chance.\r\n\r\nIn a literal sense, you can\'t perceive much more of the world than you already do. You only perceive what you really need in order to survive. David Eagleman explains:\r\n\r\nWe open our eyes and we think we\'re seeing the whole world out there. But what has become clearand really just in the last few centuriesis that when you look at the electro-magnetic spectrum we are seeing less than 1/10 Billionth of the information that\'s riding on there. So we call that visible light. But everything else passing through our bodies is completely invisible to us.\r\n\r\nEven though we accept the reality that\'s presented to us, we\'re really only seeing a little window of what\'s happening. There\'s so many examples of this, but one that\'s interesting to third-graders, but also neuroscience is optical illusions. [Illusions demonstrate] that these really simple things that you think are going on in front of you are not actually representing physical reality but instead your brain is constructing something.\r\n\r\nOur construction of reality shapes and alters our view of the physical world. It also limits our cognitive ability because we weigh our views more importantly than others. Mr. Wilson explains:\r\n\r\nA lot of this happens unconsciously. We don\'t know how much we\'re interpreting. The world presents itself like it\'s reality and we don\'t know how much we\'ve already filtered that. There\'s a psychologist name Lee Brosan who calls this naive realism. We perceive the world as real, but we\'re doing a lot of spinning as the information comes in. He talks about it as a real impediment when we\'re in an argument because each person sees the world as real and thinks the other must be crazy or deliberately trying to destroy things when in fact they\'re just trying to bring their own expectations and facts to the table.\r\n\r\nRecognizing this limited view is the first step. David Eagleman describes this as the umwelt: the assumption that our reality is the only reality out there. He suggests the first thing we have to do is recognize our umwelt.\r\n\r\nThe key is when you appreciate the umwelt it gives you intellectual humility. You realize that even though you assume this is reality, there is so much you\'re not seeing and so much that\'s a part of other people\'s reality. The usefulness is recognizing this humility when making a hypothesis.\r\n\r\nRecognizing our own umwelt can help us recalibrate our version of reality and start looking at the world in a new and different way. Most of us can\'t do this by flipping a switch and require some exercises to get our brains into the habit of looking through other perspectives before making choices. Let\'s look at some of the ways you can utilize and act on this idea. Photo by neuroticcamel.\r\n\r\nHow to Alter Your Larger Outlook\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest reasons to recalibrate your reality is to attempt to expand your world outlook outside of yourself to help you become a better communicator and expand your problem solving ability. This is easier said than done. Let\'s look at ways you can actually implement it in your day.\r\n\r\nWait Five Minutes Before Your Respond\r\n\r\n\r\nOne regret most of us have is our stupid responses during debates or heated arguments. To help cure that and give yourself time to think, 37signals author Jason Fried suggests a simple approach: give it five minutes. He describes a situation where he was arguing with a speaker at a conference who eventually offered him this advice:\r\n\r\nHe said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it\'s fine to disagree, it\'s fine to push back, it\'s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you\'re sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\r\n\r\nMany arguments don\'t offer the luxury of a five minute response, but others, like email, social networks, or even conferences, give you plenty of time to formulate your response and recalibrate your reality before you say something stupid. Simply letting ideas settle in will inevitably force you to reconsider your own viewpoints, weigh them against your own, and give you an opportunity to come up with a better response. Photo by Valentina Powers.\r\n\r\nForce Yourself to Think from Alternate Points of View in Monotonous Situations\r\n\r\nIt\'s not all about making yourself better at arguing a point. It can also be used as a form of stress relief for daily annoyances. In his commencement speech given to the graduating class at Kenyon University in 2005, author David Foster Wallace talked about the dangers of self-centered worldview and the importance of disrupting our \"default setting\" and views of the world by considering other options.\r\n\r\nHis suggestion is pretty simple. When you get annoyed at a situation or another person, think about why you would do what they\'re doing. For example, if you\'re in the checkout line and a woman smacks her kid, consider how you would end up in that situation. Alternately, if someone cuts you off in traffic, imagine why (or even when) you\'ve done the same thing. Putting yourself in that mindset can change your view of a situation. As Wallace points out, doing this on a regular basis disrupts your default-setting and makes you more conscious of the world around you.\r\n\r\nWrite Out Your Day From Another Point of View\r\n\r\nIn his book, Mr. Wilson talks about the importance of writing things down as a means to understand different perspectives and one way to do that is to take a look at your daywhether that\'s work, your creative life, or happinessfrom the third person. He explains:\r\n\r\nSome researchers have developed a method where they say, if something is nagging at us, write about it in the third person so we can look at it as objectively as we can as opposed to immersing ourselves in a negative experience. That kind of distance can be really helpful to change our story and to look at it in a new way and give new meaning to it.\r\n\r\nI think I try to do this sometimes. I remind myself that my interpretation of something is just thatan interpretation. It\'s not the only way. Sometimes it\'s good to to look at a situation the opposite way as an exercise.\r\n\r\nIt might make you feel a little like Bob Dole for a minute, but writing out your day from a different point of view will give you a unique perspective of your situation and can help you pinpoint where a problem is.\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t just about altering your view of the rest of the world though, it\'s also useful to recalibrate your perception of yourself. Let\'s see how you can do it. Photo by vtsr.\r\n\r\nAlter Your Perception of Self to Expand Your Notions of the World\r\n\r\nAs we\'ve seen above, we see the world through our own set of filters, but changing and recognizing those filters isn\'t too difficult. More difficult is editing your self-perception in order to change how you view the world. It\'s a bit difficult to imagine changing your own view, but here\'s a few ways you can do it.\r\n\r\nEdit Your Own Story\r\n\r\nOne of the central themes in Mr. Wilson\'s book is the idea that you unconsciously form your own narratives that frame the world and shape your sense of reality. Like any story, these narratives can be edited with a technique he calls story-editing.\r\n\r\nThe goal of story-editing is to change your personal interpretations of yourself and the social world to make yourself happier. One way Mr. Wilson suggests doing this is using the Pennebaker Writing Exercise. The process is pretty simple.\r\n\r\nFind a quiet, private place to write.\r\nCommit to writing about a problem for fifteen minutes a day for three consecutive days.\r\nEach time your write about a stress or problem, you reveal more and can subsequently edit your version of the story and understand it more. It\'s the same premise as five minute idea mentioned above. The writing exercise creates a self-assessment of your view and helps you consider other sides of a problem. This helps you interpret yourself differently in the social world and can provide insight into how you umwelt affects your decisions, creativity, and productivity.\r\n\r\nChange How You Present Yourself\r\n\r\nNew research from Northwestern University suggests that you may be influenced by how you present yourself. The researchers call this \"enclothed cognition\" and theorizes that clothes have an effect not just on how you\'re seen by the world, but also how you see yourself. Basically, you can alter your self-perception and subsequently your reality by wearing different clothes.\r\n\r\nThe research doesn\'t prove anything yet. Instead, it suggests that our clothes have an impact on how we view ourselves. As an experiment on yourself, outfit yourself differently for a day and take note of how people perceive you how you perceive yourself. Does wearing a tie make you feel like more of an adult? Does a uniform change the way you view work? When your self-perception is changed, so is your view of reality.\r\n\r\nTry on a Different Personality for an Hour\r\n\r\nThe idea of trying on a new personality might seem a little strange if you do it around friends and family, but doing so on a short flight or even in with a random conversation on the bus is an experience that completely alters your reality. It\'s also surprisingly easy to do. Mr. Wilson offers his experience:\r\n\r\nThe idea of trying on a new self can be a fun exercise. So, you\'re on a train or a plane and you\'re chatting with the person next to you and you just try on a new personality. For example, I tend to be a bit more on the introverted side and I often wish I was a little more talkative and socially skilled at parties and things. And that\'s something you can change if you practice it. So sometimes I\'ll just say, I\'m going to be an extrovert. And you know, I\'ll never be Mr. Extrovert, but it\'s amazing how easy it can be if you just try to adopt a different trait.\r\n\r\nI tried this idea myself. As a bit of an introvert, I tried on an extrovert hat while doing some work in a coffee shop one night. To my surprise, simply telling myself, \"I\'m an extrovert for the next two hours,\" actually made me more forthcoming to the person who was clearly trying to ignore me at the next table. It also gave me an idea of the difference in perception between an extrovert and an introvert. Where I typically would go to a coffee shop to work quietly in the corner, I took a seat closer to someone and actually engaged with them. I did this all automatically after I decided I was an extrovert and it wasn\'t until I looked back on it that I realized my seating choice and disposition was influenced by the conscious choice I made earlier.

In a lot of ways it\'s a good thing, because it\'s a great boon to productivity to not have to give cognitive thought to a lot of our daily actions, but it\'s still good to change your world slightly now and again. It\'s easy to do and can have a surprising effect.\r\n\r\nRearrange Your Home Environment to See New Things\r\n\r\nRearranging your home is an oddly relaxing way to explore your own dwelling and take a good look at the reality you form. Over years of living in an apartment or house, objects get hidden away, pictures you meant to hang get stuffed in storage, and you get so relaxed in the world you create that you don\'t spend any time paying attention to it.\r\n\r\nYou don\'t have to completely redo your living room or go out and buy anything. It is as simple as taking down the art on your walls and rearranging them in new places. You could even consider flipping a room to offer a different perspective. The goal is to provide that cognitive bump in the road so that when you walk into your house you\'re forced to reassess the situation slightly and take the time to actually think about what you\'re seeing.\r\n\r\nTake Different Routes and Find New Areas to Explore\r\n\r\nLike the rearranging of your furniture, taking alternate routes is about expanding your reality into something larger and breaking your routine enough to cause you to pause. This doesn\'t mean you have to take a new way to work every day, but it might mean taking a different street to the grocery store or jogging along a different path. When you break your routine, you move away from your reality and take in another section of the world.

The above methods can be used to work through creative blocks, problem solve issues at work, and even to deal with minor traumatic events. Once you recognize the umwelt and the embrace the idea that your perception is limited, it opens up all types of new ideas. Do you do things to recalibrate your notion of reality?
