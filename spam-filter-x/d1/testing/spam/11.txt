This letter is not intended to cause you any
embarrassment in whatever form (hence not an
unsolicited mail), rather compelete contact your
esteemed self, following knowledge of your high repute
and trustworthiness,is borne out of this difficult
situation that our family has been engulfed out since
my father and bread winner of the family was forced
torelinquish his position.

However, I know that your immediate apprehensions may
be as a result of the popular scam reports you must
have told or you must have read of. I must reiterate
however that you must not swallow hook, line and
sinker all that you have been told or read.
We are aware of these reports about scam which most
African countries have been famed for such activities.

My dear, the truth is that many people remain poor in 
life today by virtue of their ignorance of certain 
privilege information. A lot of people are ignorant of
the above information and have unwittingly blown 
several privilege opportunities that have come their 
way because they choose to leave the veil over their 
face and swallow the hook, line and sinker, the 
sponsored media report sold to them, which is exactly 
what these reports aim to achieve. It^Òs really very
pathetic
I think that your problem after you would have gone
through with this mail will be that of fear, an almost
all-consuming fear of the unknown, you are not so 
sure, you are afraid that something might go wrong and
that this business arrangements might not be
consummated or something of the sort, although I
havegiven you assurances. 

In life, dreams and fears go hand in hand, 
so it is not out of place for you to be afraid. Even 
the most courageous men on earth have their own fears,
but courage means being able to perform in the midst 
of your fear. It is said that an individual cannot 
discover new ocean until he has the courage to lose
sight of the shores. 
Please I advise you to be courageous in this 
transaction and lets go ahead with this transaction. 
Everything will work out very well to our ultimate 
mutual advantage. Do not fear or despair, as our 
transaction has no bearing or any relation with scam, 
we presently have found ourselves (men of great hope 
and aspiration) in the most trying times where because
of insufficient resources, little minds tend to spite 
us, but there is a dawn of hope, we have toiled all 
night, we can not give in to human dissuasions, 
history has a place for minds of steel. 
When they first manufactured golf balls , they  made 
the cover smooth. Then it was  discovered that after a
ball had been roughened up one could get more distance
out of it. So they started  manufacturing them with
dimpled covers. 
So it is with life, it takes some rough spots in your 
life to make you go your farthest. 

My name is Mr.PATRICK  KING ELSWORTH, the son of
Mr.Henry Elsworth of Kwekwe Zimbabwe.
During the current war crisis against the farmers in
Zimbabwe from the support of President Robert Mugabe,
because on his envy and greediness to claim all the
white-owned farms for his party members and his
followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender
all their farms(lands) to his party members and
his followers.

My father(Mr.Henry Elsworth of blessed memory) is
one of the best farmers in the country and because he
did not Support Robert Mugabe ideas, Mugabe^Òs order
his supporters to invaded my father's farm and burnt
everything in the farm in asmuch as killing my beloved
father with two of his workers who was at the farm
with him and made away with a lot of items in my
father's farm.(19 Jan 2001,firday around 3.30 pm)
Before his death, my father deposited with a Security
Company in Amsterdam,Neitherland(Europe)the sum of
US$15.5Million}{Fifteen million Five hundred thousand
United States Dollars}as family valuables. This money
is for the opening of the new 285 acares of farm land
in Shiselweni Village near Umbuluzi river in Swaziland
which my father negotiated to buy with the help of the
Swaziland Monarch King Suboza Mswati(lll) as well as
buying tractors for the newly site which my father had
made all the enquries from NEW LONDON T! RACTOR &
EQUIPMENT. ROUTE 460 WEST OF LYNCHBURG LONDON. 

After the death of my father and the bread winner of
the family,I decided to move to the Fedearal Republic
of Nigeria (as all my hopes is no longer )where my
father had deposited the Money in the Security Company
as family valuables to withdraw it and put to use. My
hopes was turn down as it is against the
constitutional human right law of Fedearal Republic of
Nigeria that asylums seeking refugee in their country
to have an account with their banks or to have an
enterprise in their country. This they showed me in
Green Paper on International Refugee(SECTION 22 ACT OF
THE REFUGEE ACT NO 13 OF 1998)prohibts it and failure
to comply on this is against the SECTION 37(B1 and B9)
of the Fedearal Republic of Nigeria laws which was in
the Agreement with United Nations High Commissionerfor
Refugees (UNHCR) in 1993.

After all this I decided to seek for an advice for on
the best way to retrieve this money(U.N.H.C.R)they
advised me that the best way is for me is to contact
an oversea person so that he can help me because as
aslyum seekers here the human right law of the country
will not allow me to move this money overseas on my
own capacity. So l decided to contact you so that you
can assist me to move this money out of Nigeria
because as asylum seekers i am not allowed to operate
any bank account within Nigeria. 
This money I have intend to use for investment in your
country. As I have two options for you.
(A)Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage
of the money for nominating your account for the
deposit when the money got claimed from Amsterdam.
(B)Or you can go into partnership with me for the
proper profitable investment of the money in your
country. Whichever the option you want, feel free
tonotify me.  

But if you do not prefer a partnership with me ,for
your rewarding kindness we shall go into negotiation.
Do remamber that you will still help me in investing
this money in your country as you can understand that
I do not have any knowledge of international business.
Would you be of kind enough to assist me.I am looking
for your reply soonest. 

Thanks and best regards
