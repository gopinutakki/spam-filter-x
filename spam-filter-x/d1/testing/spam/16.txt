I am Marcey Monte,wife of the late chief Abbey
Monte, the former chief justice of Gabon. Proposing a
mutual business relationships. We (I and my
son)currently have within our reach the sum of
Fifteen  Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars (US$15.5M) cash which we agreed to use for
investment purpose specifically in your country or your country of
choice.

This money came as a result of a pay back contract
deal between my Husband and a Chinese firm on our
country's Multi Billion Railway Construction Scheme
and the Chinese partners returned my husbands share
after his death and lodged it with our finance firm
here of which I am the director.

Right now, the opposition government has revoked our
Licenses that permits us to own a financial and oil
company which resulted to the death of my husband.

In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$15.5M from the company's vault well preserved and
packed in cases and deposited it in ECOWAS SECURITY
COMPANY. I have since declared our Finance
company bankrupt  and no record  has ever existed
concerning the money because there is no document
showing we received the money from the Chinese firm.

Furthermore, due to the current situation in the
country concerning the present government attitude
towards some retired officers,  It has become quite impossible for me
and my family to make use of the money here (Gabon), thus I seek your
assistance to move the money out of this country and keep it in your
care. It is a risk free transaction, its  a
transfer through a diplomatic baggage( security
company).
My son and I have agreed to compensate you or the
owner of the account used for this transaction with
25% of the total amount remitted.

We shall have 70% and the remaining 5% reserved for
taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your
country.

Finally, on your consent, I shall expect you to
contact me urgently to enable us discuss in details
about this transaction and bear in mind that your
early response is highly needed to transfer this fund.

It is 100% risk free,contact me through this e-mail
address  furnishing us with most
confidential telephone and fax numbers.
I must also use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this
transaction as a confidential issue.
