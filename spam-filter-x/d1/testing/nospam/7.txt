Hi gopi.nutakki@gmail.com,

Thank you for creating an OpenDNS account! You're one step closer to a safer, faster, smarter and more reliable Internet.

The next thing you should do is add a network to your account. It's easy — just log in to your account and select Networks in your Dashboard. Once you do that, you can:

 
	Set your filtering preferences.
Want to block social networks like MySpace and Facebook or bandwidth-consuming sites like YouTube? Just go to Settings in your dashboard and choose "content filtering."
 
 
	Customize with your image and messages.
Everyone on your network will see them. Just go to Settings and set "your logo" and "your messages" under Customization.
 
 
	View stats about your network activity.
Want to see which Web sites people on your network are visiting? Block problem sites in a single click? Just visit the Stats tab. (Note: it takes 24 hours for your stats to populate. Don't worry — they're coming!)
 
 
... And much more!

Also, don't forget to download the IP Updater client (for Windows and Mac OS X) after you add a network. You only need to download it on your (the account holder) machine, and it will ensure your settings remain in effect if your IP changes.
