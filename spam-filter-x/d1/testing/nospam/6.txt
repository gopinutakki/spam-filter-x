Hi bhaya...

Nina surf chesthunte i found something, Adi oka API to interact with google search.JAVA Api idi.

Also there are some test files used for demo.

I tried to extract the files in that jar file and tried to run it as a netbeans project, but i think i messed up placing files.

Can u look at it once and can u convert it to a netbeans project, where i can show those test files to Wang when asked for Demo..:P
