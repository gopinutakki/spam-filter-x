Hey,

I believe I wrote most of the program, but I couldnt test it as the systems have the firewall enabled, I cant disable them.
The attached zip file contains an eclipse project(can be directly imported into netbeans).

The host names in the a.dat files should be real names of the computers.
I am not sure whether I would be able to work on the tonight or tomorrow. Show it someone and ask them to execute and may be rewrite the parts thats not working.
