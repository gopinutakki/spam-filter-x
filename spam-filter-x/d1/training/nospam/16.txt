Hi All!
 
This is just to share with you the good news that Cody Harris in Hartford, CT has joined our team as a long-term software intern with electronics and other skills.
 
As his first task, Cody has already begun working to continue and complete the SSLab work that Gopi had begun in Bowling Green.  Jake Mendelssohn, who is the School Manager at the Connecticut Science Museum and who is known personally to several of us, recommended to both Cody and myself that we talk.  Cody currently plans to begin studies in Florida soon in aerospace engineering – and hopes to continue working with us throughout his undergraduate studies, for starters.  I believe you will find him a delightful member of the team and a significant contributor to the whole team’s efforts.
