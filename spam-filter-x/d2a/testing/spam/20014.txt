Consequently, my newly acquired properties were seized again and I had no
option than to leave the country immediately to a neighboring west African
country, where I met our Lord Jesus Christ and my life was totally
transformed. But before I left I was able to first move my money out of
the country. I had $10,500,000 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) in my domiciliary account in Freetown. I had to move the
money out of the Country through a very secret arranged channel, in a very
unconventional method this was done by my friend an official at the
Security Minting & Printing Company of my country. Presently, this money
is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm.
