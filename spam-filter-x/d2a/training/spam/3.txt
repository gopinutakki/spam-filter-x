PLC (N/Oil) and member of 5 MAN Contract Executive
Review Panel (comprising 2 Snr.Staff of CBN and 3
Snr,Staff Of (N/Oil) set up by present Civilian Regime
of President Obasanjo. So far we have come across a
surplus of the sum of US$27M.(Twenty-seven Million
Dollars)which was as a result of deliberate
over-invoicing of certain contracts awarded by
Contract Award Committee of the cooperation.

I decided to contact you base on the fact that I have
no foreign partner to assist me in executing the
transaction. If you accept to carry out this business
with me, please note that my colleague and me will be
in your Country to receive the fund together with you,
the moment we secure all the necessary approvals.

You should also note that the transaction would only
take (14) fourteen working days.
