We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundredand Forty Two
Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00) from a in Africa.

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will
be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up
a new bank account immediately to receive this money,though an empty bank
account could serve this purposeas long as you will remain honest to me
till the end of this important business trusting in you andbelieving in
God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.

While the total amount involved is One hundred andForty Two Million United
States Dollars(U.S.$142,000,000.00)only. I would want us to make a first
transfer of [Forty Two Million United States Dollar. (U.S.$42,000,000.00)
from this money into a safe Foreigners account abroad before the rest. I
am onlycontacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved
to a local account, without validinternational foreign ^ÓAgreement^Ô, but
could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
credentials: passport or drivers license and foreign account because this
sum is in U.S. dollars and the former owner of the account
Mr.Eshed.B.Willey is aforeigner too, thus the money could only be
approvedinto a foreign account.

At the conclusion of this business, you will begiven 35% of the
total amount, 60% will be for me,while 5% will be for expenses both
parties might haveincurred during this process.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.
