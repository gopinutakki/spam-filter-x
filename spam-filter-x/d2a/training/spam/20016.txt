In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$15.5M from the company's vault well preserved and
packed in cases and deposited it in ECOWAS SECURITY
COMPANY. I have since declared our Finance
company bankrupt  and no record  has ever existed
concerning the money because there is no document
showing we received the money from the Chinese firm.

We shall have 70% and the remaining 5% reserved for
taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your
country.

It is 100% risk free,contact me through this e-mail
address  furnishing us with most
confidential telephone and fax numbers.
I must also use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this
transaction as a confidential issue.
