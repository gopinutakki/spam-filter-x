be surprising  to you to receive  this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in
this transaction,  which I propose with my free mind
and as a person of integrity.  My name is Owen Weah,
the first son of Phillip Weah Personal assistant to
the president Charles Taylor

Liberia,a country in West Africa is presently torn
apart by strife and armed rebellion.These upheavals
have led to the intervention of the American
government which has insisted that the incumbent
president Charles Taylor,vacate his position and allow
an international peacekeeping force to act as a
transitional government.

These monies amount to approximately (16. 500.000 million Euros)

It is important that you expedite action in this
transaction if you are interested, because time is of
the essence.Confidentiality is also of great
