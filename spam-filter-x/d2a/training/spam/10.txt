Through some discreet inquiries from my Chambers of Commerce, you and your
organization were revealed as being quite astute in private
entrepreneurship. One has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial
business of considerable amount, which will form a bedrock of an extensive
business partnership in due course. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you as a respected executive of your company to believe that you
will handle it with all maturity and confidentiality it deserves.

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  (NNPC).

Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm by my committee in
NNPC. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M (Twenty One
Million, Five Hundred Thousand). This was done deliberately. The
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.

We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this opportunity. We
want this money to be transferred to the overseas Account for us.

Please contact me immediately through my confidential email
"kola-adams@excite.com" whether or not you are interested in this deal. If
you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry
out this deal.

Time is of essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest cooperation.
