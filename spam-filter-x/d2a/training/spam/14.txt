First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue
of its nature as being
utterly confidential and top secret. We shall be counting on your ability
and reliability to
prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business
transaction
requiring
maximum confidence.

We have agreed to share the money thus:
70% for us (the officials)
20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you)
10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this
transaction.
