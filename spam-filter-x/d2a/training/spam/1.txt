I am Mr.David Mark. an Auditor of a BANK OF THE NORTH 
INTERNATIONAL,ABUJA
(FCT). I have the courage to Crave indulgence for 
this important business
believing that you will never let me down 
either now or in the future. Some
years ago, an American Mining 
consultant/ contractor with the Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation,
made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar
months, valued 
$12M.USD (TWELVE MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account. On maturity,
The 
bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no 
reply. This
is the situation, and my proposal 
is that I am looking for a foreigner who will
stand in as the next of 
kin to beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account abroad to
facilitate the 
transfer of this money. If you are
interested, please reply immediately through my personal email sending 
the
following details: (1) Your Full Name/Address (2) Your Private 
Telephone/fax
Number. Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and be 
rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of 
us because I shall require your
assistance to invest some of my share 
in your country. I look forward to your
earliest reply.
